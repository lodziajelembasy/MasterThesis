2019-02-01,Friday,"Remind yourself of the old days when, after enlightenment, you withstood the great struggle, that is, torments, already publicly exposed to mockery and persecution, already becoming the companions of those who experienced it. For you have suffered with the imprisoned, and you have accepted the plunder of your possessions with joy, knowing that you own a better and lasting estate. Do not deprive yourself of your trust, which finds great retribution. For you need perseverance, that after fulfilling the will of God, you will fulfill the promise. ""For yet a short, very short moment, and the One who is to come will come, and he will not be late, and my righteous, thanks to faith, will live, if he withdraws, my soul will not find pleasure in him."" We do not belong to the apostates who go into perdition but to the faithful who save the soul.",The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord,"Have confidence in the Lord and do what is good and you will live on earth and live safely. Rejoice in the Lord and He will fulfill the desires of your heart. Tell the Lord your path, trust Him and He will act. He will make your justice shine like light, and your righteousness like the glint of the south. He strengthens the steps of a man on a path that is nice to him. And even if he falls, he will not lie, because his hand will sustain the Lord. The deliverance of the righteous comes from the Lord, he escapes them during the time of trouble. The Lord helps them and releases them, free them from the wicked ones and keeps them, for he is their refuge.",None,"I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You revealed the mysteries of the kingdom to simpletons.","Jesus said to the multitudes: ""The kingdom of God is as if someone puts the seed into the earth, whether he is awake or awake, day and night, the seed sprouts and grows, he does not know how. The earth itself yields, first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear, and when the crop matures, the sickle begins to grow, for it is time for harvest. "" He said: ""What are we to compare the kingdom of God with or in what parables we present it?"" It is like a mustard seed, it is the smallest of all seeds on the earth when it is sown in the ground, but sown, grows and becomes larger than other vegetables; large branches, so that the birds of the sky will nest in its shadow. "" In many of these parables, he preached to them as far as they could understand. And without a parable he did not speak to them. He explained everything to his students separately."
2019-01-31,Thursday,"Brothers, we are sure that we will enter the Holy Place through the blood of Jesus. He ushered in a new and living way, through the veil, that is through his body. Having a great priest who is above the house of God, let us enter with the right heart, with full faith, cleansed from the soul of all conscious evil and washed on the body with pure water. Let us hold on to the unshakable hope that we profess, for he who promised is trustworthy. Let us care for each other to encourage love and good deeds. Let us not leave our joint meetings, as it has been done by some, but let us encourage each other, and the more so, the more clearly you see that the day is approaching.",This is a faithful people seeking God,"The land belongs to the Lord and everything that fills it, the whole world and its inhabitants. For he set him in the seas and established him over the rivers. Who will go up to the mountain of the Lord, who will stand in his holy place? A man of undefiled hands and a pure heart whose soul has not clung to vanity. He will receive a blessing from the Lord and payment from God, his Savior. This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek the face of God the God.",None,", 105) Your word is a torch for my feet, Lord, and light on my path.","Jesus said to the people, ""Is this why light is brought in to put it under a bushel or under a bed, not in order to place it on a lampstand?"" For there is nothing hidden that would not come to light. listen, let him listen! "" And he said to them, ""See what you are listening to. The same measure that you measure will measure you out and make it to you, because whoever has it will be added, and whoever does not will deprive him of what he has."""
2019-01-30,Wednesday,"Every priest of the Old Testament becomes daily to perform his ministry and many times makes the same sacrifices that can not take away sins with any measure. On the contrary, having offered one sacrifice for sins once and for all, he sat at the right hand of God, waiting only ""until his enemies become a footstool under his feet."" For he has perfected for one and all time those who are sanctified. And the Holy Spirit gives us testimony when he said: ""This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will give my rights in their hearts, I will write them in their minds. And for their sins and their wickedness no more I mention "". Where their remission is, there is no longer a need for sacrifice for sins.","You are a priest, just like Melchizedek","The Lord said to my Lord, ""Sit on my right hand, until I will make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet."" The Lord will stretch the power of Thy scepter with Zion, ""Be thou strong with thy enemies, for thy rule, on the day of Thy triumph, in the light of holiness, from the womb of the dawn I bear you as dew."" The Lord has sworn and will not cancel it: ""You are a priest forever after the Melchizedek model.""",None,"The word of God is the seed, and the sower is Christ, everyone who finds him will live forever.","Jesus again began to teach at the lake and a very large crowd gathered with Him. That's why he entered the boat and sat in it, on the lake, and the whole crowd stood on the edge of the lake. He taught them many things in parables and told them in their studies: ""Hear, Behold, the sower went out to sow."" And as he sowed, one seed fell on the road, and the birds came and devoured them. And soon it arose, because it was not deep in the soil, but the sun came down and withered because it had no root, another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew and drowned them, so that it did not bear fruit, others finally fell fertile and seemed fertile yield, rising and growing, and yielded a crop of thirty-fold, sixty-fold and a hundredfold. "" And he added: ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"" And when he was alone, those who were with him, along with the twelve, asked him about the parable. He replied to them: ""You are given the mystery of the kingdom of God, for those who are beyond you, everything happens in parables,"" to look carefully, not to see, listen carefully, and do not understand that they do not repent and are not forgiven them wine. ""And he said to them,"" Do not you understand this parable? How then will you understand other parables? The sower sows the word. And behold, there are those who are on the way: with them the word is sown, and if they hear it, Satan comes in and kidnaps the word sown in them. Similarly, the sowing on the rocky ground are those who, when they hear the word, immediately accept it with joy, but they have no root in them and are unstable. Then when there is oppression or persecution because of a word, they break down immediately. There are others who are sown among the thorns: those who listen to the word, but the concerns of this world, the deceitfulness of wealth and other cravings squeeze in and drown out the word, so that it remains fruitless. Finally, the fertile people planted on the earth are those who listen to the word, accept it and produce a fruit: thirtyfold, sixtyfold and one hundredfold. """
2019-01-29,Tuesday,"The law, having only the shadow of future goods, and not the very image of things, by the same sacrifices that are constantly being made every year, can never perfect those who approach God. For have they not ceased to compose them, if they, having been cleansed once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of their sins? But through them each year is a reminder of sins. It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to remove sins. Therefore, Christ, coming into the world, says: ""You did not want sacrifice or gift, but you created a body for me, burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, then I said: Here I am - in the scroll of the book I am written - to fulfill Your will, God "". He said above: ""Sacrifice, gifts, burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you did not want and did not like You"", although they are made in accordance with the Law. Then he said, ""Behold, I go to fulfill Your will."" Removes one victim to establish another. By this will, we are sanctified by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.","I am coming, God, to do Your will","Hopefully, I waited for the Lord and He bent over me. He put a song in my mouth for a new song for our God. You did not want blood sacrifice or the fruit of the earth, but you opened my ears; You did not ask for a burnt offering and a sacrifice for sins. Then I said, ""Behold, I come."" I proclaimed Your justice in the great assembly and did not restrain my lips, as You know, Lord. I did not hide your injustice in my heart, I proclaimed Your loyalty and help. I did not deny Your grace or Your fidelity to the great assembly.",None,"I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You revealed the mysteries of the kingdom to simpletons.","The Mother of Jesus came and the brothers, standing outside, sent for him to call him. And a crowd of people sat around him, when they said to him, ""Behold, your mother and brothers are looking for you outside."" He answered them, ""Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"" And looking at those sitting around him, he said, ""Behold my mother and my brethren, for whoever does God's will, he is my brother, my sister and my mother."""
2019-01-28,Monday,"Christ is the mediator of the New Covenant, so that through death, sustained for the redemption of crimes committed for the first covenant, those who are called to eternal inheritance have come to fulfill their promise. Christ did not enter into the temple built by human hands, which is a reflection of the true temple, but to heaven itself, to intercede for us before God, and not to sacrifice himself many times, like the high priest who comes to temple with blood of someone else, because in that case he would have to suffer many times since the creation of the world. Meanwhile, one time appeared at the end of the ages to take away the sin of the self-sacrifice. And as the people decided to die once, then the judgment, so Christ once was sacrificed for the sins of many, the second time will appear not in connection with sin, but for the salvation of those who expect Him.",Sing to the Lord because he did miracles,"Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done wonders. His right hand and His holy arm prepared his victory. He showed his salvation and revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles. He remembered his goodness and loyalty to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth were saved, the salvation of our God. Rejoice in praise of the Lord, all the earth, rejoice, rejoice and play. Sing to the Lord with the tones of the citrons, with the lithium and with the sound of the harp. With the trumpet and the voice of the horn, in the eyes of the Lord, King, rejoice.",None,"Our Savior, Jesus Christ, has conquered death and threw light on the Gospel.","The scribes who came from Jerusalem spoke of Jesus: ""He has Beelzebub and casts out evil spirits by the power of the ruler of evil spirits."" Then Jesus called them to them and told them in the parables, ""How can Satan cast out Satan?"" If a kingdom is inwardly quarreled, such a kingdom can not stand, and if a house is divided against itself, then such a house will not be able to stand. therefore Satan stood against himself and is divided against himself, he can not stand, but end with him, no one can enter a strong man's house and rob him, if he does not bind him first, and then he will plunder his house. to you: All sins and blasphemies that would be committed by people will be forgiven them, but whoever would blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will never receive remission, but he must be eternal. "" For they said: ""He has an unclean spirit."""
2019-01-27,Sunday,"Priest Ezra brought the law before the congregation, in which mainly men participated, but also women and all others who were able to hear. And he read from this book, facing the square in front of the Water Gate, from morning till noon before men, women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were turned toward the book of the law. The writer Ezra stood on a wooden platform, which was made for this purpose. Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was higher than all the people; and when he opened it, all the people arose. And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people, raising their hands, answered: ""Amen, Amen!"" Then they worshiped and prostrated themselves before the Lord, face to the ground. So they read from this book, the book of the law of God, emphatically, with the addition of explanation, so that the people understood reading. Then Nehemiah, the vicegerent, and the priest-writer Ezra, as well as the Levites, who instructed the people, said to the whole people: ""This day is dedicated to the Lord your God, do not be sad and do not weep!"" For all the people cried when he heard these words of the law. And Nehemiah said to them, ""Go, eat Christmas food and drink sweet drinks, send also portions to him who has nothing ready: for this day is our God's day, and do not be despised, for joy in the Lord is your refuge.""","Your words, Lord, are spirit and life","The law of the Lord is perfect and comforts the soul, the Lord's testimony is certain, he teaches wisdom in hesitant. His righteous precepts rejoice in the heart, the Lord's commandment is radiant and his eyes are dazzling. The Lord's love is sincere and lasts forever, the judgments of the Lord true, all right together. Let the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be appreciated before You, Lord, my Opoko and my Savior.","Just as one is a body, although it is made up of many members, and all members of the body, although numerous, constitute one body, so too is Christ. For all of us have been baptized in one Spirit to be one Body: be it Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free. We have all been made drink with one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but numerous members. If the leg said, ""Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body"" - does it really belong to the body? Or if the ear would say, ""Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body"" - would it not belong to the body? If the whole body were eyesight, where would the hearing be? Or if all were hearing, where would the smell be? But God, as He wanted, created different members, arranging each of them in the body. If the whole were one member, where would the body be? In the meantime, there are many members, but one body. So he can not say an eye to his hand: ""You do not need me,"" or head to my feet: ""I do not need you"". Rather, even those who are considered weaker are necessary for the body; and those that we consider not worthy of respect, the more we give respect. Thus, we especially care for the decency of shameful members of the body, because there is no need for those who are not shy. But God shaped our body so much that a respectful member gained little respect from nature, that split in the flesh would not arise, but that individual members would care for each other. Thus, when one member suffers, all other members suffer; similarly, when one member is shown respect, all members are being held together. You are the body of Christ and its individual members. And so God set the Church forward for the apostles, second for the prophets, third for the teachers, then those who have the power to do miracles, then those who heal, support those who govern, who speak different languages. Are they all apostles? Do everyone prophesy? Are they all teachers? Do all have the power to do miracles? Do all have the grace of healing? Do everyone speak in tongues? Can everyone explain it?","The Lord sent me, that I would bring good news to the poor, and that freedom was given to prisoners.","Many have already tried to put together a story about the events that happened among us, just as those who were from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. So I decided to investigate everything right from the first moments and describe you one by one, dignified Theophilus, so that you could be convinced of the absolute certainty of the teachings you were given. At that time: Jesus returned with the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and the news of him spread throughout the whole region. He taught in their synagogues, praised by all. He also came to Nazareth, where he grew up. On the Sabbath day, he went to the synagogue with his custom and rose to read. A book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He opened the book and found a place where it was written: ""The Spirit of the Lord rests upon me, because he has anointed me and sent me, that I may bring good news to the poor, and let the prisoners read freedom, and send free people to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."" Wrapping the book, he gave the servant and sat down; and all eyes in the synagogue were fixed on him. So he began to say to them, ""Today these words of the Scripture that you have heard have come true."""

Proclaim among the peoples that the Lord is king. he confirmed the world so that he would not shake, he would justly judge peoples.",None,"The Lord sent Me to proclaim the good news to the poor, and to freedom for the prisoners.","Then the Lord appointed another seventy-two, and sent them two by two in front of him to every city and town where he intended to come. He also said to them, ""The harvest is great, but the laborers are few: ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go, I send you like sheep among the wolves, carry no purse or bag, no sandals, no one When you come to what house you enter, first say: Peace to this house If there is a man who is worthy of peace, your peace will rest on him, if not he will return to you, stay in the same house, eating and drinking what they have: because he deserves his payment, do not go home from home, if you enter and accept you, eat what they give you, heal the sick who are there, and tell them: The kingdom of God has come closer to you."
2019-01-25,Friday,"Paul said to the people, ""I am a Jew who was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but I grew up in this city, I got a thorough education at the feet of Gamaliel, I zealously served God as you all serve today. the death penalty, binding and imprisoning men and women, which can be witnessed by both the high priest and the whole elders, from them I received letters to the brothers and went to Damascus with the intention of imprisoning those who were there and bringing them to Jerusalem to punish them On the way, when I approached Damascus, suddenly around noon I was surrounded by great brightness from heaven, I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"" I replied, ""Who are you, Lord?"" He said to me, ""I am Jesus, a Nazarene whom you persecute."" My companions, on the other hand, saw the light but I did not hear the voice that spoke to me, so I said, ""What should I do, Lord?"" And the Lord said to me, ""Get up, go to Damascus, they will tell you everything you do."" Since I had been blinded by the light of that light, I came to Damascus, led by the hand of my companions. A certain Ananias, a man faithfully observing the Law, of whom all the Jews gave a good testimony, came to me and said: ""Saul, brother, look!"" At that moment I looked at him. He said: ""God of our fathers chose you that you would know His will and see the Righteous and hear His own voice. For all people will testify to what you have seen and heard. Why are you delaying now? Baptize and wash from your sins by calling His name!

And those who believe will follow these signs. : In my name, the evil spirits will throw away, they will speak in new tongues, they will take snakes into their hands, and if they drink anything of a poison, they will not harm them, they will put their hands on the sick, and they will regain their health.

2019-01-24,Thursday,"Jesus can completely save those who go through to God forever, because he is still alive to intercede for them. For we needed such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens, one who is not obliged, like other high priests, to make daily sacrifices first for their sins and then for the sins of the people. For he has done this once and for all, offering himself. For the law instituted the high priests of men who were weakened, and the word of the oath, made after the giving of the law, establishes the high priest of the perfect Son forever. At the heart of the argument is the truth: we have such a high priest, who sat at the right hand of the Majestic throne in the heavens, as a servant of the temple and a true sanctuary built by the Lord, not by man. For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; it is therefore necessary that he also have something to offer. So if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because there are others who sacrifice according to the law. They serve the image and shadow of the heavenly realities. For when Moses was to build the tabernacle, he was instructed in this way by God: ""Take care that you do all things according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain."" And now Christ has received so much loftier service, if he also became the mediator of a better covenant, which was based on better promises.","I am coming, God, to do Your will","You did not want blood sacrifice or the fruit of the earth, but you opened my ears; You did not ask for a burnt offering and a sacrifice for sins. Then I said, ""Here I come. In the scroll of the book it is written about me: It is my joy for me to do my will, my God, and your law lives in my heart."" I have proclaimed Your justice in a great gathering and I have not restrained my lips, as You know, Lord.

And a great many people came from Galilee with him. Also from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumea, and from Zajordania, and from the vicinity of Tire and Sidon, many great news came to him about how much he acted. So he instructed his disciples that the boat would be ready for him constantly, because of the crowd, that they would not be stressed against him. For many have healed, and as a result all who have had some illnesses, pressed to Him to touch Him. Even the unclean spirits, at His sight, fell before Him and cried, ""You are the Son of God."" But he strictly forbade them not to reveal Him."
2019-01-23,Wednesday,"Melchizedek, the king of Shalem, the priest of God the Most High, went out to meet Abraham, returning after the defeat of the kings, and gave him a blessing. To him, Abraham also tithed tithing from all loot. His first name means the king of justice, and then also king Szalem, this is the king of peace. Without a father, without a mother, without pedigree, he has neither the beginning of his days nor the end of his life, but he is like a son of God forever. This is even more evident when, in the likeness of Melchizedek, another priest is established who has become so not according to the carnal provision of the Law, but according to the power of indestructible life. For he is given such a testimony: ""You are a priest forever after the example of Melchizedek.""","You are a priest, just like Melchizedek","The Lord said to my Lord, ""Sit on my right hand, until I will make Your enemies a footstool of Your feet."" The Lord will stretch the power of Thy scepter with Zion, ""Be thou strong with thy enemies, for thy rule, on the day of Thy triumph, in the light of holiness, from the womb of the dawn I bear you as dew.""

He said to them, ""What is allowed on the Sabbath: to do something good or something bad? Save life or kill?"" But they were silent. Then, looking at them with anger, grieved over the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man: ""Hold your hand out!"" He stretched out, and his hand became healthy again. And the Pharisees went out, and with the supporters of Herod, they immediately consulted against Him, how to destroy Him."
2019-01-22,Tuesday,"It is not God's unrighteousness to forget about your deeds and the love that you showed for His name, when you were serving the saints and still serving. We would like each one of you to show the same zeal in perfecting hope until the end, so that you do not become lethargic, but imitate those who by faith and patience become heirs of promises. For when God made Abraham a promise, having no one greater to whom he could have sworn, he swore to himself, saying: ""I will bless you with generosity, and I will multiply you exceedingly."" And because Abraham waited so patiently, he received what was promised. People swear to someone higher, and the oath to find the truth is the end of any dispute between them. That is why God, wanting to show the heirs of promise beyond all limits, strengthened them with an oath, so that we would have a permanent comfort, two things that we can not lie to, that we have recovered to grasp the offered hope.

Therefore, having the great high priest who passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us continue strongly in the profession of faith. For we do not have a high priest who would not sympathize with our weaknesses, but who would be tested in all respects as we did - except for sin.
