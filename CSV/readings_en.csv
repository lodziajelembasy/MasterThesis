They were sent on their journey by the Church,and passed through Phoenicia and Samariatelling of the conversion of the Gentiles,and brought great joy to all the brethren.When they arrived in Jerusalem,they were welcomed by the Church,as well as by the Apostles and the presbyters,and they reported what God had done with them.But some from the party of the Pharisees who had become believersstood up and said, ""It is necessary to circumcise themand direct them to observe the Mosaic law.""The Apostles and the presbyters met together to see about this matter.

2019-05-20,Monday,"There was an attempt in Iconiumby both the Gentiles and the Jews,together with their leaders,to attack and stone Paul and Barnabas.They realized it,and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbeand to the surrounding countryside,where they continued to proclaim the Good News.At Lystra there was a crippled man, lame from birth,who had never walked. He listened to Paul speaking, who looked intently at him,saw that he had the faith to be healed,and called out in a loud voice, ""Stand up straight on your feet.""He jumped up and began to walk about.When the crowds saw what Paul had done,they cried out in Lycaonian,""The gods have come down to us in human form."" They called Barnabas ""Zeus"" and Paul ""Hermes,""because he was the chief speaker.And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city,brought oxen and garlands to the gates,for he together with the people intended to offer sacrifice.The Apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their garmentswhen they heard this and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,""Men, why are you doing this? We are of the same nature as you, human beings. We proclaim to you good newsthat you should turn from these idols to the living God,who made heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them.In past generations he allowed all Gentiles to go their own ways;yet, in bestowing his goodness,he did not leave himself without witness,for he gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,and filled you with nourishment and gladness for your hearts.""Even with these words, they scarcely restrained the crowdsfrom offering sacrifice to them.","R.

2019-05-18,Saturday,"On the following sabbathalmost the whole citygathered to hear the word of the Lord. When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousyand with violent abuse contradicted what Paul said.

For so the Lord has commanded us,I have made you a light to the Gentiles,that you may be an instrument of salvationto the ends of the earth.""The Gentiles were delighted when they heard thisand glorified the word of the Lord. All who were destined for eternal life came to believe,and the word of the Lord continued to spreadthrough the whole region. The Jews, however, incited the women of prominence who were worshipersand the leading men of the city,stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas,and expelled them from their territory.

2019-05-17,Friday,"When Paul came to Antioch in Pisidia, he said in the synagogue:""My brothers, children of the family of Abraham,and those others among you who are God-fearing,to us this word of salvation has been sent. The inhabitants of Jerusalem and their leaders failed to recognize him,and by condemning him they fulfilled the oracles of the prophetsthat are read sabbath after sabbath. For even though they found no grounds for a death sentence,they asked Pilate to have him put to death,and when they had accomplished all that was written about him,they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead,and for many days he appeared to thosewho had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These are now his witnesses before the people.We ourselves are proclaiming this good news to youthat what God promised our fathershe has brought to fulfillment for us, their children, by raising up Jesus,as it is written in the second psalm,You are my Son; this day I have begotten you.""","R.

2019-05-16,Thursday,"From Paphos, Paul and his companionsset sail and arrived at Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem. They continued on from Perga and reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the sabbath they entered into the synagogue and took their seats. After the reading of the law and the prophets,the synagogue officials sent word to them,""My brothers, if one of you has a word of exhortationfor the people, please speak.""So Paul got up, motioned with his hand, and said,""Fellow children of Israel and you others who are God-fearing, listen.The God of this people Israel chose our ancestorsand exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt. With uplifted arm he led them out,and for about forty years he put up with them in the desert.When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,he gave them their land as an inheritanceat the end of about four hundred and fifty years.After these things he provided judges up to Samuel the prophet. Then they asked for a king.God gave them Saul, son of Kish,a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. Then he removed him and raised up David as their king;of him he testified,I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart;he will carry out my every wish.From this man's descendants God, according to his promise,has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus. John heralded his coming by proclaiming a baptism of repentanceto all the people of Israel;and as John was completing his course, he would say,'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he.Behold, one is coming after me;I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.'""","R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.or:R.

2019-05-15,Wednesday,"The word of God continued to spread and grow. After Barnabas and Saul completed their relief mission,they returned to Jerusalem,taking with them John, who is called Mark. Now there were in the Church at Antioch prophets and teachers:Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene,Manaen who was a close friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,""Set apart for me Barnabas and Saulfor the work to which I have called them."" Then, completing their fasting and prayer,they laid hands on them and sent them off.So they, sent forth by the Holy Spirit,went down to Seleuciaand from there sailed to Cyprus. When they arrived in Salamis,they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. ","R. O God, let all the nations praise you!or:R.

2019-05-14,Tuesday,"Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers and sisters.He said, ""My brothers and sisters,the Scripture had to be fulfilledwhich the Holy Spirit spoke beforehandthrough the mouth of David, concerning Judas,who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus.Judas was numbered among usand was allotted a share in this ministry.For it is written in the Book of Psalms:Let his encampment become desolate,and may no one dwell in it.and:May another take his office.Therefore, it is necessary that one of the men who accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,beginning from the baptism of Johnuntil the day on which he was taken up from us,become with us a witness to his resurrection.""So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas,who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.Then they prayed,""You, Lord, who know the hearts of all,show which one of these two you have chosento take the place in this apostolic ministryfrom which Judas turned away to go to his own place.""Then they gave lots to them, and the lot fell upon Matthias,and he was counted with the Eleven Apostles.","R.

2019-05-13,Monday,"The Apostles and the brothers who were in Judeaheard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalemthe circumcised believers confronted him, saying,'You entered the house of uncircumcised people and ate with them."" Peter began and explained it to them step by step, saying,""I was at prayer in the city of Joppawhen in a trance I had a vision,something resembling a large sheet coming down,lowered from the sky by its four corners, and it came to me. Looking intently into it,I observed and saw the four-legged animals of the earth,the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky. I also heard a voice say to me, 'Get up, Peter. Slaughter and eat.' But I said, 'Certainly not, sir,because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' But a second time a voice from heaven answered,'What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.' This happened three times,and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.Just then three men appeared at the house where we were,who had been sent to me from Caesarea. The Spirit told me to accompany them without discriminating. These six brothers also went with me,and we entered the man's house. He related to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, saying,'Send someone to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter,who will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.' As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon themas it had upon us at the beginning,and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said,'John baptized with waterbut you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' If then God gave them the same gift he gave to uswhen we came to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,who was I to be able to hinder God?""When they heard this,they stopped objecting and glorified God, saying,""God has then granted life-giving repentance to the Gentiles too.""","R.

2019-05-11,Saturday,"The Church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samariawas at peace. She was being built up and walked in the fear of the Lord,and with the consolation of the Holy Spirit she grew in numbers.As Peter was passing through every region,he went down to the holy ones living in Lydda. There he found a man named Aeneas,who had been confined to bed for eight years, for he was paralyzed. Peter said to him,“Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed.” He got up at once. And all the inhabitants of Lydda and Sharon saw him,and they turned to the Lord.Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha. She was completely occupied with good deeds and almsgiving. Now during those days she fell sick and died,so after washing her, they laid her out in a room upstairs. Since Lydda was near Joppa,the disciples, hearing that Peter was there,sent two men to him with the request,“Please come to us without delay.” So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the room upstairswhere all the widows came to him weepingand showing him the tunics and cloaksthat Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed. Then he turned to her body and said, “Tabitha, rise up.” She opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up. He gave her his hand and raised her up,and when he had called the holy ones and the widows,he presented her alive. This became known all over Joppa,and many came to believe in the Lord. ","R.

2019-05-10,Friday,"Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord,went to the high priest and asked himfor letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that,if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way,he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains. On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus,a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?""He said, ""Who are you, sir?"" The reply came, ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do."" The men who were traveling with him stood speechless,for they heard the voice but could see no one.Saul got up from the ground,but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing;so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus.For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank.There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias,and the Lord said to him in a vision, ""Ananias."" He answered, ""Here I am, Lord."" The Lord said to him, ""Get up and go to the street called Straightand ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul.He is there praying,and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananiascome in and lay his hands on him,that he may regain his sight.""But Ananias replied,""Lord, I have heard from many sources about this man,what evil things he has done to your holy ones in Jerusalem.And here he has authority from the chief prieststo imprison all who call upon your name."" But the Lord said to him,""Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mineto carry my name before Gentiles, kings, and children of Israel,and I will show him what he will have to suffer for my name."" So Ananias went and entered the house;laying his hands on him, he said,""Saul, my brother, the Lord has sent me,Jesus who appeared to you on the way by which you came,that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."" Immediately things like scales fell from his eyesand he regained his sight. He got up and was baptized,and when he had eaten, he recovered his strength.He stayed some days with the disciples in Damascus,and he began at once to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues,that he is the Son of God.","R.

2019-05-09,Thursday,"The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip,""Get up and head south on the roadthat goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, the desert route."" So he got up and set out. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch,a court official of the Candace,that is, the queen of the Ethiopians,in charge of her entire treasury,who had come to Jerusalem to worship, and was returning home.Seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.The Spirit said to Philip,""Go and join up with that chariot."" Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said,""Do you understand what you are reading?"" He replied,""How can I, unless someone instructs me?"" So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him. This was the Scripture passage he was reading:Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter,and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,so he opened not his mouth.In his humiliation justice was denied him.Who will tell of his posterity?For his life is taken from the earth.Then the eunuch said to Philip in reply,""I beg you, about whom is the prophet saying this?About himself, or about someone else?"" Then Philip opened his mouth and, beginning with this Scripture passage,he proclaimed Jesus to him.As they traveled along the roadthey came to some water,and the eunuch said, ""Look, there is water. What is to prevent my being baptized?"" Then he ordered the chariot to stop,and Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water,and he baptized him. When they came out of the water,the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away,and the eunuch saw him no more,but continued on his way rejoicing. Philip came to Azotus, and went about proclaiming the good newsto all the towns until he reached Caesarea.","R. Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.or:R.

Create a clean heart in me, O God.Epistle Rom 6:3-11Brothers and sisters:Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesuswere baptized into his death?We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death,so that, just as Christ was raised from the deadby the glory of the Father,we too might live in newness of life.For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his,we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.We know that our old self was crucified with him,so that our sinful body might be done away with,that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.For a dead person has been absolved from sin.If, then, we have died with Christ,we believe that we shall also live with him.We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;death no longer has power over him.As to his death, he died to sin once and for all;as to his life, he lives for God.Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as being dead to sinand living for God in Christ Jesus."
2019-04-19,Friday,"See, my servant shall prosper,he shall be raised high and greatly exalted.Even as many were amazed at him--so marred was his look beyond human semblanceand his appearance beyond that of the sons of man--so shall he startle many nations,because of him kings shall stand speechless;for those who have not been told shall see,those who have not heard shall ponder it.Who would believe what we have heard?To whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?He grew up like a sapling before him,like a shoot from the parched earth;there was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him,nor appearance that would attract us to him.He was spurned and avoided by people,a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity,one of those from whom people hide their faces,spurned, and we held him in no esteem.Yet it was our infirmities that he bore,our sufferings that he endured,while we thought of him as stricken,as one smitten by God and afflicted.But he was pierced for our offenses,crushed for our sins;upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole,by his stripes we were healed.We had all gone astray like sheep,each following his own way;but the LORD laid upon himthe guilt of us all.Though he was harshly treated, he submittedand opened not his mouth;like a lamb led to the slaughteror a sheep before the shearers,he was silent and opened not his mouth.Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away,and who would have thought any more of his destiny?When he was cut off from the land of the living,and smitten for the sin of his people,a grave was assigned him among the wickedand a burial place with evildoers,though he had done no wrongnor spoken any falsehood.But the LORD was pleasedto crush him in infirmity.If he gives his life as an offering for sin,he shall see his descendants in a long life,and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.Because of his afflictionhe shall see the light in fullness of days;through his suffering, my servant shall justify many,and their guilt he shall bear.Therefore I will give him his portion among the great,and he shall divide the spoils with the mighty,because he surrendered himself to deathand was counted among the wicked;and he shall take away the sins of many,and win pardon for their offenses.","R.  Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.In you, O LORD, I take refuge;let me never be put to shame.In your justice rescue me.Into your hands I commend my spirit;you will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God.R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.For all my foes I am an object of reproach,a laughingstock to my neighbors, and a dread to my friends;they who see me abroad flee from me.I am forgotten like the unremembered dead;I am like a dish that is broken.R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.But my trust is in you, O LORD;I say, ""You are my God.In your hands is my destiny; rescue mefrom the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors.""R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.Let your face shine upon your servant;save me in your kindness.Take courage and be stouthearted,all you who hope in the LORD.R. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.","Brothers and sisters:Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.For we do not have a high priestwho is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has similarly been tested in every way,yet without sin.So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.In the days when Christ was in the flesh, he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered; and when he was made perfect,he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.Verse Before the Gospel Phil 2:8-9Christ became obedient to the point of death,even death on a cross.Because of this, God greatly exalted himand bestowed on him the name which is above every other name.","Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.Judas his betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, went out and said to them, ""Whom are you looking for?""They answered him, ""Jesus the Nazorean.""He said to them, ""I AM.""Judas his betrayer was also with them.When he said to them, ""I AM, "" they turned away and fell to the ground.So he again asked them,""Whom are you looking for?""They said, ""Jesus the Nazorean.""Jesus answered,""I told you that I AM.So if you are looking for me, let these men go.""This was to fulfill what he had said, ""I have not lost any of those you gave me.""Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear.The slave's name was Malchus.Jesus said to Peter,""Put your sword into its scabbard.Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?""So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus,bound him, and brought him to Annas first.He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus.Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.But Peter stood at the gate outside.So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, ""You are not one of this man's disciples, are you?""He said, ""I am not.""Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal firethat they had made, because it was cold,and were warming themselves.Peter was also standing there keeping warm.The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.Jesus answered him,""I have spoken publicly to the world.I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have said nothing.  Why ask me?Ask those who heard me what I said to them.They know what I said.""When he had said this, one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, ""Is this the way you answer the high priest?""Jesus answered him,""If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?""Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm.And they said to him,""You are not one of his disciples, are you?""He denied it and said,""I am not.""One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, ""Didn't I see you in the garden with him?""Again Peter denied it.And immediately the cock crowed.Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium.It was morning.And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.So Pilate came out to them and said, ""What charge do you bring against this man?""They answered and said to him,""If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.""At this, Pilate said to them, ""Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.""The Jews answered him, ""We do not have the right to execute anyone, "" in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilledthat he said indicating the kind of death he would die.So Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?""Jesus answered,""Do you say this on your own or have others told you about me?""Pilate answered,""I am not a Jew, am I?Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.What have you done?""Jesus answered,""My kingdom does not belong to this world.If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.But as it is, my kingdom is not here.""So Pilate said to him,""Then you are a king?""Jesus answered,""You say I am a king.For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.""Pilate said to him, ""What is truth?""When he had said this,he again went out to the Jews and said to them,""I find no guilt in him.But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover.Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?""They cried out again,""Not this one but Barabbas!""Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak, and they came to him and said,""Hail, King of the Jews!""And they struck him repeatedly.Once more Pilate went out and said to them, ""Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.""So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.And he said to them, ""Behold, the man!""When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, ""Crucify him, crucify him!""Pilate said to them,""Take him yourselves and crucify him.I find no guilt in him.""The Jews answered, ""We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.""Now when Pilate heard this statement,he became even more afraid, and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, ""Where are you from?""Jesus did not answer him.So Pilate said to him,""Do you not speak to me?Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you?""Jesus answered him,""You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above.For this reason the one who handed me over to youhas the greater sin.""Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, ""If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar.Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.""When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge's bench in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon.And he said to the Jews,""Behold, your king!""They cried out,""Take him away, take him away!  Crucify him!""Pilate said to them,""Shall I crucify your king?""The chief priests answered,""We have no king but Caesar.""Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.So they took Jesus, and, carrying the cross himself, he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross.It read,""Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.""Now many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, ""Do not write 'The King of the Jews,'but that he said, 'I am the King of the Jews'.""Pilate answered,""What I have written, I have written.""When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier.They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.So they said to one another, ""Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be, "" in order that the passage of Scripture might be fulfilled that says:They divided my garments among them,and for my vesture they cast lots.This is what the soldiers did.Standing by the cross of Jesus were his motherand his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,and Mary of Magdala.When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he lovedhe said to his mother, ""Woman, behold, your son.""Then he said to the disciple,""Behold, your mother.""And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, ""I thirst.""There was a vessel filled with common wine.So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth.When Jesus had taken the wine, he said,""It is finished.""And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.Here all kneel and pause for a short time.Now since it was preparation day,in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and that they be taken down.So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs, but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may come to believe.For this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:Not a bone of it will be broken.And again another passage says:They will look upon him whom they have pierced.After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus.And Pilate permitted it.So he came and took his body.Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds.They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by."

Lord, in your great love, answer me.For your sake I bear insult,and shame covers my face.I have become an outcast to my brothers,a stranger to my mother's sons,because zeal for your house consumes me,and the insults of those who blaspheme you fall upon me.R. Lord, in your great love, answer me.Insult has broken my heart, and I am weak,I looked for sympathy, but there was none;for consolers, not one could I find.Rather they put gall in my food,and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.R. Lord, in your great love, answer me.I will praise the name of God in song,and I will glorify him with thanksgiving:""See, you lowly ones, and be glad;you who seek God, may your hearts revive!For the LORD hears the poor,and his own who are in bonds he spurns not.""R. Lord, in your great love, answer me.","Hail to you, our King;you alone are compassionate with our errors.","Gospel Mt 26:14-25One of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,went to the chief priests and said,""What are you willing to give meif I hand him over to you?""They paid him thirty pieces of silver,and from that time on he looked for an opportunity to hand him over.On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,the disciples approached Jesus and said,""Where do you want us to preparefor you to eat the Passover?""He said,""Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,'The teacher says, ""My appointed time draws near;in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples.""'""The disciples then did as Jesus had ordered,and prepared the Passover.When it was evening,he reclined at table with the Twelve.And while they were eating, he said,""Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.""Deeply distressed at this,they began to say to him one after another,""Surely it is not I, Lord?""He said in reply,""He who has dipped his hand into the dish with meis the one who will betray me.The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.It would be better for that man if he had never been born.""Then Judas, his betrayer, said in reply,""Surely it is not I, Rabbi?""He answered, ""You have said so."" "
2019-04-16,Tuesday,"Hear me, O islands,listen, O distant peoples.The LORD called me from birth,from my mother's womb he gave me my name.He made of me a sharp-edged swordand concealed me in the shadow of his arm.He made me a polished arrow,in his quiver he hid me.You are my servant, he said to me,Israel, through whom I show my glory.Though I thought I had toiled in vain,and for nothing, uselessly, spent my strength,Yet my reward is with the LORD,my recompense is with my God.For now the LORD has spokenwho formed me as his servant from the womb,That Jacob may be brought back to himand Israel gathered to him;And I am made glorious in the sight of the LORD,and my God is now my strength!It is too little, he says, for you to be my servant,to raise up the tribes of Jacob,and restore the survivors of Israel;I will make you a light to the nations,that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.","R.   I will sing of your salvation.In you, O LORD, I take refuge;let me never be put to shame.In your justice rescue me, and deliver me;incline your ear to me, and save me.R. I will sing of your salvation.Be my rock of refuge,a stronghold to give me safety,for you are my rock and my fortress.O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked.R.

I will sing of your salvation.My mouth shall declare your justice,day by day your salvation.O God, you have taught me from my youth,and till the present I proclaim your wondrous deeds.R. I will sing of your salvation.","Hail to you, our King, obedient to the Father;you were led to your crucifixion like a gentle lamb to the slaughter.","Reclining at table with his disciples, Jesus was deeply troubled and testified,""Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.""The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he meant.One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved,was reclining at Jesus' side.So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom he meant.He leaned back against Jesus' chest and said to him,""Master, who is it?""Jesus answered,""It is the one to whom I hand the morsel after I have dipped it.""So he dipped the morsel and took it and handed it to Judas,son of Simon the Iscariot.After Judas took the morsel, Satan entered him.So Jesus said to him, ""What you are going to do, do quickly.""Now none of those reclining at table realized why he said this to him.Some thought that since Judas kept the money bag, Jesus had told him,""Buy what we need for the feast,""or to give something to the poor.So Judas took the morsel and left at once. And it was night.When he had left, Jesus said,""Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself,and he will glorify him at once.My children, I will be with you only a little while longer.You will look for me, and as I told the Jews,'Where I go you cannot come,' so now I say it to you.""Simon Peter said to him, ""Master, where are you going?""Jesus answered him,""Where I am going, you cannot follow me now,though you will follow later.""Peter said to him,""Master, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.""Jesus answered, ""Will you lay down your life for me?Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crowbefore you deny me three times."""
2019-04-15,Monday,"Here is my servant whom I uphold,my chosen one with whom I am pleased,Upon whom I have put my Spirit;he shall bring forth justice to the nations,Not crying out, not shouting,not making his voice heard in the street.A bruised reed he shall not break,and a smoldering wick he shall not quench,Until he establishes justice on the earth;the coastlands will wait for his teaching.Thus says God, the LORD,who created the heavens and stretched them out,who spreads out the earth with its crops,Who gives breath to its peopleand spirit to those who walk on it:I, the LORD, have called you for the victory of justice,I have grasped you by the hand;I formed you, and set youas a covenant of the people,a light for the nations,To open the eyes of the blind,to bring out prisoners from confinement,and from the dungeon, those who live in darkness.","R.    The Lord is my light and my salvation.The LORD is my light and my salvation;whom should I fear?The LORD is my life's refuge;of whom should I be afraid?R.

The Lord is my light and my salvation.","Hail to you, our King;you alone are compassionate with our faults.","Six days before Passover Jesus came to Bethany,where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.They gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served,while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with him. Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oilmade from genuine aromatic nardand anointed the feet of Jesus and dried them with her hair;the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil. Then Judas the Iscariot, one of his disciples,and the one who would betray him, said,""Why was this oil not sold for three hundred days' wagesand given to the poor?""He said this not because he cared about the poorbut because he was a thief and held the money bagand used to steal the contributions.So Jesus said, ""Leave her alone.Let her keep this for the day of my burial.You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.""The large crowd of the Jews found out that he was there and came,not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus,whom he had raised from the dead.And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,because many of the Jews were turning awayand believing in Jesus because of him."
2019-04-14,Sunday,"Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples.He said, ""Go into the village opposite you, and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat.Untie it and bring it here.And if anyone should ask you,'Why are you untying it?' you will answer,'The Master has need of it.'""So those who had been sent went off and found everything just as he had told them.And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ""Why are you untying this colt?""They answered,""The Master has need of it.""So they brought it to Jesus,threw their cloaks over the colt, and helped Jesus to mount.As he rode along,the people were spreading their cloaks on the road; and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of his disciplesbegan to praise God aloud with joyfor all the mighty deeds they had seen.They proclaimed:""Blessed is the king who comesin the name of the Lord.Peace in heavenand glory in the highest.""Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,""Teacher, rebuke your disciples.""He said in reply,""I tell you, if they keep silent,the stones will cry out!""At the Mass – Reading I Is 50:4-7The Lord GOD has given mea well-trained tongue,that I might know how to speak to the wearya word that will rouse them.Morning after morninghe opens my ear that I may hear;and I have not rebelled,have not turned back.I gave my back to those who beat me,my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;my face I did not shieldfrom buffets and spitting.The Lord GOD is my help,therefore I am not disgraced;I have set my face like flint,knowing that I shall not be put to shame.","R.   My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?All who see me scoff at me;they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads:""He relied on the LORD; let him deliver him,let him rescue him, if he loves him.""R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?Indeed, many dogs surround me,a pack of evildoers closes in upon me;They have pierced my hands and my feet;I can count all my bones.R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?They divide my garments among them,and for my vesture they cast lots.But you, O LORD, be not far from me;O my help, hasten to aid me.R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?I will proclaim your name to my brethren;in the midst of the assembly I will praise you:""You who fear the LORD, praise him;all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to him; revere him, all you descendants of Israel!""R. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?","Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God,did not regard equality with Godsomething to be grasped.Rather, he emptied himself,taking the form of a slave,coming in human likeness;and found human in appearance,he humbled himself,becoming obedient to the point of death,even death on a cross.Because of this, God greatly exalted himand bestowed on him the namewhich is above every name,that at the name of Jesusevery knee should bend,of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,and every tongue confess thatJesus Christ is Lord,to the glory of God the Father.Verse Before the Gospel Phil 2:8-9Christ became obedient to the point of death,even death on a cross.because of this, God greatly exalted himand bestowed on him the name which is above every name.","When the hour came,Jesus took his place at table with the apostles.He said to them, ""I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,for, I tell you, I shall not eat it again until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.""Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, ""Take this and share it among yourselves; for I tell you that from this time on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.""Then he took the bread, said the blessing,broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ""This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in memory of me.""And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood,which will be shed for you.""And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray meis with me on the table; for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined;but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.""And they began to debate among themselves who among them would do such a deed.Then an argument broke out among themabout which of them should be regarded as the greatest.He said to them,""The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors'; but among you it shall not be so.Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest, and the leader as the servant.For who is greater: the one seated at table or the one who serves?Is it not the one seated at table?I am among you as the one who serves.It is you who have stood by me in my trials;and I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred one on me, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thronesjudging the twelve tribes of Israel.""Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demandedto sift all of you like wheat,but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back,you must strengthen your brothers.""He said to him,""Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.""But he replied,""I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day,you will deny three times that you know me.""He said to them,""When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals,were you in need of anything?""""No, nothing, "" they replied.He said to them,""But now one who has a money bag should take it,and likewise a sack, and one who does not have a swordshould sell his cloak and buy one.For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me,namely, He was counted among the wicked;and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.""Then they said,""Lord, look, there are two swords here.""But he replied, ""It is enough!""Then going out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives,and the disciples followed him.When he arrived at the place he said to them, ""Pray that you may not undergo the test.""After withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling,he prayed, saying, ""Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done.""And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like drops of bloodfalling on the ground.When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.He said to them, ""Why are you sleeping?Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.""While he was still speaking, a crowd approached and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas.He went up to Jesus to kiss him.Jesus said to him, ""Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?""His disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked, ""Lord, shall we strike with a sword?""And one of them struck the high priest's servantand cut off his right ear.But Jesus said in reply,""Stop, no more of this!""Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him.And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards and elders who had come for him, ""Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?Day after day I was with you in the temple area,and you did not seize me;but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.""After arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it,and Peter sat down with them.When a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said,""This man too was with him.""But he denied it saying,""Woman, I do not know him.""A short while later someone else saw him and said, ""You too are one of them""; but Peter answered, ""My friend, I am not.""About an hour later, still another insisted, ""Assuredly, this man too was with him,for he also is a Galilean.""But Peter said,""My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.""Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord,how he had said to him,""Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.""He went out and began to weep bitterly.The men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, ""Prophesy!  Who is it that struck you?""And they reviled him in saying many other things against him.When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.They said, ""If you are the Christ, tell us, "" but he replied to them, ""If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I question, you will not respond.But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.""They all asked, ""Are you then the Son of God?""He replied to them, ""You say that I am.""Then they said, ""What further need have we for testimony?We have heard it from his own mouth.""Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.They brought charges against him, saying, ""We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Christ, a king.""Pilate asked him, ""Are you the king of the Jews?""He said to him in reply, ""You say so.""Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, ""I find this man not guilty.""But they were adamant and said, ""He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea,from Galilee where he began even to here.""On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean; and upon learning that he was under Herod's jurisdiction,he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.Herod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time,for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.He questioned him at length,but he gave him no answer.The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile,stood by accusing him harshly.Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him,and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate.Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly.Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people and said to them, ""You brought this man to meand accused him of inciting the people to revolt.I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him, nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us.So no capital crime has been committed by him.Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.""But all together they shouted out, ""Away with this man!Release Barabbas to us.""— Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder. —Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,but they continued their shouting,""Crucify him!  Crucify him!""Pilate addressed them a third time,""What evil has this man done?I found him guilty of no capital crime.Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.""With loud shouts, however,they persisted in calling for his crucifixion,and their voices prevailed.The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.So he released the man who had been imprisonedfor rebellion and murder, for whom they asked,and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.As they led him awaythey took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus.A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him.Jesus turned to them and said, ""Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren,the wombs that never boreand the breasts that never nursed.'At that time people will say to the mountains,'Fall upon us!'and to the hills, 'Cover us!'for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?""Now two others, both criminals,were led away with him to be executed.When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left.Then Jesus said,""Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.""They divided his garments by casting lots.The people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, ""He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Christ of God.""Even the soldiers jeered at him.As they approached to offer him wine they called out,""If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.""Above him there was an inscription that read, ""This is the King of the Jews.""Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying,""Are you not the Christ?Save yourself and us.""The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply,""Have you no fear of God,for you are subject to the same condemnation?And indeed, we have been condemned justly,for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.""Then he said,""Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.""He replied to him,""Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.""It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole landuntil three in the afternoonbecause of an eclipse of the sun.Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.Jesus cried out in a loud voice, ""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit""; and when he had said this he breathed his last.Here all kneel and pause for a short time.The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said,""This man was innocent beyond doubt.""When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened,they returned home beating their breasts;but all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events.Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who,though he was a member of the council, had not consented to their plan of action.He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea and was awaiting the kingdom of God.He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen clothand laid him in a rock-hewn tombin which no one had yet been buried.It was the day of preparation,and the sabbath was about to begin.The women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind, and when they had seen the tomb and the way in which his body was laid in it, they returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils.Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.Or Lk 23:1-49The elders of the people, chief priests and scribes,arose and brought Jesus before Pilate.They brought charges against him, saying,""We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Christ, a king.""Pilate asked him, ""Are you the king of the Jews?""He said to him in reply, ""You say so.""Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, ""I find this man not guilty.""But they were adamant and said, ""He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea,from Galilee where he began even to here.""On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;

2019-04-13,Saturday,"Thus says the Lord GOD:I will take the children of Israel from among the nationsto which they have come,and gather them from all sides to bring them back to their land.I will make them one nation upon the land,in the mountains of Israel,and there shall be one prince for them all. Never again shall they be two nations,and never again shall they be divided into two kingdoms.No longer shall they defile themselves with their idols,their abominations, and all their transgressions. I will deliver them from all their sins of apostasy,and cleanse them so that they may be my peopleand I may be their God.My servant David shall be prince over them,and there shall be one shepherd for them all;they shall live by my statutes and carefully observe my decrees.They shall live on the land that I gave to my servant Jacob,the land where their fathers lived;they shall live on it forever,they, and their children, and their children's children,with my servant David their prince forever.I will make with them a covenant of peace;it shall be an everlasting covenant with them,and I will multiply them, and put my sanctuary among them forever.My dwelling shall be with them;I will be their God, and they shall be my people.Thus the nations shall know that it is I, the LORD,who make Israel holy,when my sanctuary shall be set up among them forever.","R.   The Lord will guard us, as a shepherd guards his flock.Hear the word of the LORD, O nations,proclaim it on distant isles, and say:He who scattered Israel, now gathers them together,he guards them as a shepherd his flock.R. The Lord will guard us, as a shepherd guards his flock.The LORD shall ransom Jacob,he shall redeem him from the hand of his conqueror.Shouting, they shall mount the heights of Zion,they shall come streaming to the LORD's blessings:The grain, the wine, and the oil,the sheep and the oxen.R. The Lord will guard us, as a shepherd guards his flock.Then the virgins shall make merry and dance,and young men and old as well.I will turn their mourning into joy,I will console and gladden them after their sorrows.R. The Lord will guard us, as a shepherd guards his flock.","Cast away from you all the crimes you have committed, says the LORD,and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.","Many of the Jews who had come to Maryand seen what Jesus had done began to believe in him.But some of them went to the Phariseesand told them what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and the Phariseesconvened the Sanhedrin and said,""What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs.If we leave him alone, all will believe in him,and the Romans will comeand take away both our land and our nation.""But one of them, Caiaphas,who was high priest that year, said to them,""You know nothing,nor do you consider that it is better for youthat one man should die instead of the people,so that the whole nation may not perish.""He did not say this on his own,but since he was high priest for that year,he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,and not only for the nation,but also to gather into one the dispersed children of God.So from that day on they planned to kill him.So Jesus no longer walked about in public among the Jews,but he left for the region near the desert,to a town called Ephraim,and there he remained with his disciples.Now the Passover of the Jews was near,and many went up from the country to Jerusalembefore Passover to purify themselves.They looked for Jesus and said to one anotheras they were in the temple area, ""What do you think?That he will not come to the feast?"""

If it calls them gods to whom the word of God came,and Scripture cannot be set aside,can you say that the onewhom the Father has consecrated and sent into the worldblasphemes because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

Or the prophets, who died?Who do you make yourself out to be?""

So the Jews said to him,""You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham?""Jesus said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you,before Abraham came to be, I AM.""So they picked up stones to throw at him;but Jesus hid and went out of the temple area."

2019-04-08,Monday,"In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,who married a very beautiful and God-fearing woman, Susanna,the daughter of Hilkiah;her pious parents had trained their daughteraccording to the law of Moses.Joakim was very rich;he had a garden near his house,and the Jews had recourse to him oftenbecause he was the most respected of them all.That year, two elders of the people were appointed judges,of whom the Lord said, ""Wickedness has come out of Babylon:from the elders who were to govern the people as judges.""These men, to whom all brought their cases,frequented the house of Joakim.When the people left at noon,Susanna used to enter her husband's garden for a walk.When the old men saw her enter every day for her walk,they began to lust for her.They suppressed their consciences;they would not allow their eyes to look to heaven,and did not keep in mind just judgments.One day, while they were waiting for the right moment,she entered the garden as usual, with two maids only.She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.Nobody else was there except the two elders,who had hidden themselves and were watching her.""Bring me oil and soap,"" she said to the maids,""and shut the garden doors while I bathe.""As soon as the maids had left,the two old men got up and hurried to her.""Look,"" they said, ""the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us;give in to our desire, and lie with us.If you refuse, we will testify against youthat you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.""""I am completely trapped,"" Susanna groaned.""If I yield, it will be my death;if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guiltthan to sin before the Lord.""Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,as one of them ran to open the garden doors.When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden,they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.At the accusations by the old men,the servants felt very much ashamed,for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day,the two wicked elders also came,fully determined to put Susanna to death.Before all the people they ordered:""Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah,the wife of Joakim.""When she was sent for,she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.In the midst of the people the two elders rose upand laid their hands on her head.Through tears she looked up to heaven,for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.The elders made this accusation:""As we were walking in the garden alone,this woman entered with two girlsand shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime,we ran toward them.We saw them lying together,but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we;he opened the doors and ran off.Then we seized her and asked who the young man was,but she refused to tell us.We testify to this.""The assembly believed them,since they were elders and judges of the people,and they condemned her to death.But Susanna cried aloud:""O eternal God, you know what is hiddenand are aware of all things before they come to be:you know that they have testified falsely against me.Here I am about to die,though I have done none of the thingswith which these wicked men have charged me.""The Lord heard her prayer.As she was being led to execution,God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,and he cried aloud:""I will have no part in the death of this woman.""All the people turned and asked him, ""What is this you are saying?""He stood in their midst and continued,""Are you such fools, O children of Israel!To condemn a woman of Israel without examinationand without clear evidence?Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.""Then all the people returned in haste.To Daniel the elders said,""Come, sit with us and inform us,since God has given you the prestige of old age.""But he replied,""Separate these two far from each other that I may examine them.""After they were separated one from the other,he called one of them and said:""How you have grown evil with age!Now have your past sins come to term:passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent,and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says,'The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'Now, then, if you were a witness,tell me under what tree you saw them together.""""Under a mastic tree,"" he answered.Daniel replied, ""Your fine lie has cost you your head,for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from himand split you in two.""Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought.Daniel said to him,""Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah, beauty has seduced you,lust has subverted your conscience.This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel,and in their fear they yielded to you;but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.""""Under an oak,"" he said.Daniel replied, ""Your fine lie has cost you also your head,for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in twoso as to make an end of you both.""The whole assembly cried aloud,blessing God who saves those who hope in him.They rose up against the two elders,for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury.According to the law of Moses,they inflicted on themthe penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:they put them to death.Thus was innocent blood spared that day.Or Dn 13:41c-62The assembly condemned Susanna to death.But Susanna cried aloud:""O eternal God, you know what is hiddenand are aware of all things before they come to be:you know that they have testified falsely against me.Here I am about to die,though I have done none of the thingswith which these wicked men have charged me.""The Lord heard her prayer.As she was being led to execution,God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,and he cried aloud:""I will have no part in the death of this woman.""All the people turned and asked him,""What is this you are saying?""He stood in their midst and continued,""Are you such fools, O children of Israel!To condemn a woman of Israel without examinationand without clear evidence?Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.""Then all the people returned in haste.To Daniel the elders said,""Come, sit with us and inform us,since God has given you the prestige of old age.""But he replied,""Separate these two far from each other that I may examine them.""After they were separated one from the other,he called one of them and said:""How you have grown evil with age!Now have your past sins come to term:passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent,and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says,'The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'Now, then, if you were a witness,tell me under what tree you saw them together.""""Under a mastic tree,"" he answered.Daniel replied, ""Your fine lie has cost you your head,for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from himand split you in two.""Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought.Daniel said to him, ""Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience.This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel,and in their fear they yielded to you;but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.""""Under an oak,"" he said.Daniel replied, ""Your fine lie has cost you also your head,""for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in twoso as to make an end of you both.""The whole assembly cried aloud,blessing God who saves those who hope in him.They rose up against the two elders,for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury.According to the law of Moses,they inflicted on themthe penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:they put them to death.Thus was innocent blood spared that day.",R.   Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; for you are at my side.The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.In verdant pastures he gives me repose;Beside restful waters he leads me;he refreshes my soul.R. Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; for you are at my side.He guides me in right pathsfor his name's sake.Even though I walk in the dark valleyI fear no evil; for you are at my sideWith your rod and your staffthat give me courage.R.

Even though I walk in the dark valley I fear no evil; for you are at my side.,"I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, says the Lord,but rather in his conversion, that he may live.","Jesus spoke to them again, saying,""I am the light of the world.Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness,but will have the light of life."" So the Pharisees said to him,""You testify on your own behalf,so your testimony cannot be verified.""Jesus answered and said to them,""Even if I do testify on my own behalf, my testimony can be verified,     because I know where I came from and where I am going.But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.You judge by appearances, but I do not judge anyone.And even if I should judge, my judgment is valid,because I am not alone,but it is I and the Father who sent me.Even in your law it is writtenthat the testimony of two men can be verified.I testify on my behalf and so does the Father who sent me.""So they said to him, ""Where is your father?""Jesus answered, ""You know neither me nor my Father.If you knew me, you would know my Father also.""He spoke these wordswhile teaching in the treasury in the temple area.But no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."

2019-04-05,Friday,"The wicked said among themselves, thinking not aright:""Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us;he sets himself against our doings,Reproaches us for transgressions of the lawand charges us with violations of our training.He professes to have knowledge of Godand styles himself a child of the LORD.To us he is the censure of our thoughts; merely to see him is a hardship for us,Because his life is not like that of others,and different are his ways.He judges us debased;he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure.He calls blest the destiny of the justand boasts that God is his Father.Let us see whether his words be true;let us find out what will happen to him.For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend himand deliver him from the hand of his foes.With revilement and torture let us put him to the testthat we may have proof of his gentlenessand try his patience.Let us condemn him to a shameful death;for according to his own words, God will take care of him.""These were their thoughts, but they erred;for their wickedness blinded them,and they knew not the hidden counsels of God;neither did they count on a recompense of holinessnor discern the innocent souls' reward.","R.   The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.The LORD confronts the evildoers,to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.When the just cry out, the LORD hears them,and from all their distress he rescues them.R.

2019-04-04,Thursday,"The LORD said to Moses,""Go down at once to your peoplewhom you brought out of the land of Egypt,for they have become depraved.They have soon turned aside from the way I pointed out to them,making for themselves a molten calf and worshiping it,sacrificing to it and crying out,'This is your God, O Israel,who brought you out of the land of Egypt!'The LORD said to Moses,""I see how stiff-necked this people is.Let me alone, then,that my wrath may blaze up against them to consume them.Then I will make of you a great nation.""But Moses implored the LORD, his God, saying,""Why, O LORD, should your wrath blaze up against your own people,whom you brought out of the land of Egyptwith such great power and with so strong a hand?Why should the Egyptians say,'With evil intent he brought them out,that he might kill them in the mountainsand exterminate them from the face of the earth'?Let your blazing wrath die down;relent in punishing your people. Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel,and how you swore to them by your own self, saying,'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky;and all this land that I promised,I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.'""So the LORD relented in the punishmenthe had threatened to inflict on his people.","R.   Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.Our fathers made a calf in Horeband adored a molten image;They exchanged their gloryfor the image of a grass-eating bullock.R. Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.They forgot the God who had saved them,who had done great deeds in Egypt,Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham,terrible things at the Red Sea.R. Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.Then he spoke of exterminating them,but Moses, his chosen one,Withstood him in the breachto turn back his destructive wrath.R. Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.","God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son,so that everyone who believes in him might have eternal life.","Jesus said to the Jews: ""If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is not true.But there is another who testifies on my behalf,and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is true.You sent emissaries to John, and he testified to the truth.I do not accept human testimony,but I say this so that you may be saved.He was a burning and shining lamp,and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light.But I have testimony greater than John's.The works that the Father gave me to accomplish,these works that I perform testify on my behalfthat the Father has sent me.Moreover, the Father who sent me has testified on my behalf.But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form,and you do not have his word remaining in you,because you do not believe in the one whom he has sent.You search the Scriptures,because you think you have eternal life through them;even they testify on my behalf.But you do not want to come to me to have life.""I do not accept human praise;moreover, I know that you do not have the love of God in you. I came in the name of my Father,but you do not accept me;yet if another comes in his own name,you will accept him.How can you believe, when you accept praise from one anotherand do not seek the praise that comes from the only God?Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father:the one who will accuse you is Moses,in whom you have placed your hope.For if you had believed Moses,you would have believed me,because he wrote about me. But if you do not believe his writings,how will you believe my words?"""
2019-04-03,Wednesday,"Thus says the LORD:In a time of favor I answer you,on the day of salvation I help you;and I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people,To restore the landand allot the desolate heritages,Saying to the prisoners: Come out!To those in darkness: Show yourselves!Along the ways they shall find pasture,on every bare height shall their pastures be.They shall not hunger or thirst,nor shall the scorching wind or the sun strike them;For he who pities them leads themand guides them beside springs of water.I will cut a road through all my mountains,and make my highways level.See, some shall come from afar,others from the north and the west,and some from the land of Syene.Sing out, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth,break forth into song, you mountains.For the LORD comforts his peopleand shows mercy to his afflicted.But Zion said, ""The LORD has forsaken me;my Lord has forgotten me.""Can a mother forget her infant,be without tenderness for the child of her womb?Even should she forget,I will never forget you.","R.   The Lord is gracious and merciful.The LORD is gracious and merciful,slow to anger and of great kindness.The LORD is good to alland compassionate toward all his works.R.

The Lord is gracious and merciful.","I am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord;whoever believes in me will never die.","Jesus answered the Jews: ""My Father is at work until now, so I am at work.""For this reason they tried all the more to kill him,because he not only broke the sabbathbut he also called God his own father, making himself equal to God.Jesus answered and said to them,""Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son cannot do anything on his own,but only what he sees the Father doing;for what he does, the Son will do also.For the Father loves the Sonand shows him everything that he himself does,and he will show him greater works than these,so that you may be amazed.For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life,so also does the Son give life to whomever he wishes.Nor does the Father judge anyone,but he has given all judgment to the Son,so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.Whoever does not honor the Sondoes not honor the Father who sent him.Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever hears my wordand believes in the one who sent mehas eternal life and will not come to condemnation,but has passed from death to life.Amen, amen, I say to you, the hour is coming and is now herewhen the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God,and those who hear will live.For just as the Father has life in himself,so also he gave to the Son the possession of life in himself.And he gave him power to exercise judgment,because he is the Son of Man.Do not be amazed at this,because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombswill hear his voice and will come out,those who have done good deedsto the resurrection of life,but those who have done wicked deedsto the resurrection of condemnation.""I cannot do anything on my own;I judge as I hear, and my judgment is just,because I do not seek my own willbut the will of the one who sent me."""
2019-04-02,Tuesday,"The angel brought me, Ezekiel,back to the entrance of the temple of the LORD,and I saw water flowing outfrom beneath the threshold of the temple toward the east,for the façade of the temple was toward the east;the water flowed down from the right side of the temple,south of the altar.He led me outside by the north gate,and around to the outer gate facing the east,where I saw water trickling from the right side.Then when he had walked off to the eastwith a measuring cord in his hand,he measured off a thousand cubitsand had me wade through the water, which was ankle-deep.He measured off another thousandand once more had me wade through the water,which was now knee-deep.Again he measured off a thousand and had me wade;the water was up to my waist.Once more he measured off a thousand,but there was now a river through which I could not wade;for the water had risen so high it had become a riverthat could not be crossed except by swimming.He asked me, ""Have you seen this, son of man?""Then he brought me to the bank of the river, where he had me sit.Along the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides.He said to me,""This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah,and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh. Wherever the river flows,every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live,and there shall be abundant fish,for wherever this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall grow;their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail.Every month they shall bear fresh fruit,for they shall be watered by the flow from the sanctuary.Their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for medicine.""","R.   The Lord of hosts is with us; our stronghold is the God of Jacob.

He answered them, ""The man who made me well told me,'Take up your mat and walk.'""They asked him,""Who is the man who told you, 'Take it up and walk'?""The man who was healed did not know who it was,for Jesus had slipped away, since there was a crowd there.After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him,""Look, you are well; do not sin any more,so that nothing worse may happen to you.""The man went and told the Jewsthat Jesus was the one who had made him well.Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesusbecause he did this on a sabbath.For the readings of the Optional Memorial of Saint Francis of Paola, please go here."

2019-03-22,Friday,"Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons,for he was the child of his old age;and he had made him a long tunic.When his brothers saw that their father loved him best of all his sons,they hated him so much that they would not even greet him.One day, when his brothers had goneto pasture their father's flocks at Shechem,Israel said to Joseph, ""Your brothers, you know, are tending our flocks at Shechem.Get ready; I will send you to them.""So Joseph went after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan.They noticed him from a distance,and before he came up to them, they plotted to kill him.They said to one another: ""Here comes that master dreamer!Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns here;we could say that a wild beast devoured him.We shall then see what comes of his dreams.""When Reuben heard this,he tried to save him from their hands, saying,""We must not take his life.Instead of shedding blood,"" he continued,""just throw him into that cistern there in the desert;but do not kill him outright.""His purpose was to rescue him from their handsand return him to his father. So when Joseph came up to them,they stripped him of the long tunic he had on;then they took him and threw him into the cistern,which was empty and dry.They then sat down to their meal.Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead,their camels laden with gum, balm and resinto be taken down to Egypt.Judah said to his brothers:""What is to be gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood?

Since I could see nothing because of the brightness of that light,I was led by hand by my companions and entered Damascus.""A certain Ananias, a devout observer of the law,and highly spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,came to me and stood there and said,'Saul, my brother, regain your sight.'And at that very moment I regained my sight and saw him.Then he said,'The God of our ancestors designated you to know his will,to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of his voice;for you will be his witness before allto what you have seen and heard.Now, why delay?Get up and have yourself baptized and your sins washed away,calling upon his name.'""Or Acts 9:1-22Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord,went to the high priest and asked himfor letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that,if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way,he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.On his  journey, as he was nearing Damascus,a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him.He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?""He said, ""Who are you, sir?""The reply came, ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.""

2019-01-24,Thursday,"Jesus is always able to save those who approach God through him,since he lives forever to make intercession for them.It was fitting that we should have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, higher than the heavens.He has no need, as did the high priests, to offer sacrifice day after day,first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did that once for all when he offered himself.For the law appoints men subject to weakness to be high priests, but the word of the oath, which was taken after the law, appoints a son, who has been made perfect forever.The main point of what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throneof the Majesty in heaven, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up.Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus the necessity for this one also to have something to offer.If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are those who offer gifts according to the law.They worship in a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary,as Moses was warned when he was about to erect the tabernacle.For God says, ""See that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.""Now he has obtained so much more excellent a ministry as he is mediator of a better covenant, enacted on better promises.","R.   Here am I, Lord; I come to do your will.Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,but ears open to obedience you gave me.Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;then said I, ""Behold I come.""R.

For the law appoints men subject to weakness to be high priests,but the word of the oath, which was taken after the law,appoints a son,who has been made perfect forever.Alleluia Jn 14:23R. Alleluia, alleluia.Whoever loves me will keep my word, says the Lord;and my father will love him and we will come to him.R. Alleluia, alleluia.","One of the scribes came to Jesus and asked him,""Which is the first of all the commandments?"" Jesus replied, ""The first is this:Hear, O Israel!The Lord our God is Lord alone!You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,with all your soul, with all your mind,and with all your strength.The second is this:You shall love your neighbor as yourself.There is no other commandment greater than these."" The scribe said to him, ""Well said, teacher.You are right in saying,'He is One and there is no other than he.'And 'to love him with all your heart,with all your understanding,with all your strength,and to love your neighbor as yourself'is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.""And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding,he said to him,""You are not far from the kingdom of God."" And no one dared to ask him any more questions."
