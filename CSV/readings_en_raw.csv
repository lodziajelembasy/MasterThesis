<div class=""poetry"">At that time, Jesus revealed himself again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias.<br>
He revealed himself in this way.<br>
Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,<br>
Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,<br>
Zebedee's sons, and two others of his disciples.<br>
Simon Peter said to them, ""I am going fishing.""<br>
They said to him, ""We also will come with you.""<br>
So they went out and got into the boat,<br>
but that night they caught nothing.<br>
When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore;<br>
but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.<br>
Jesus said to them, ""Children, have you caught anything to eat?""<br>
They answered him, ""No.""<br>
So he said to them, ""Cast the net over the right side of the boat<br>
and you will find something.""<br>
So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in<br>
because of the number of fish.<br>
So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ""It is the Lord.""<br>
When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,<br>
he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad,<br>
and jumped into the sea.<br>
The other disciples came in the boat,<br>
for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards,<br>
dragging the net with the fish.<br>
When they climbed out on shore,<br>
they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread.<br>
Jesus said to them, ""Bring some of the fish you just caught.""<br>
So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore<br>
full of one hundred fifty-three large fish.<br>
Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.<br>
Jesus said to them, ""Come, have breakfast.""<br>
And none of the disciples dared to ask him, ""Who are you?""<br>
because they realized it was the Lord.<br>
Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them,<br>
and in like manner the fish.<br>
This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples<br>
after being raised from the dead.<br>
When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,<br>
""Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?""<br>
Simon Peter answered him, ""Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.""<br>
Jesus said to him, ""Feed my lambs.""<br>
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,<br>
""Simon, son of John, do you love me?""<br>
Simon Peter answered him, ""Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.""<br>
Jesus said to him, ""Tend my sheep.""<br>
Jesus said to him the third time,<br>
""Simon, son of John, do you love me?""<br>
Peter was distressed that Jesus had said to him a third time,<br>
""Do you love me?"" and he said to him,<br>
""Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.""<br>
Jesus said to him, ""Feed my sheep.<br>
Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger,<br>
you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted;<br>
but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands,<br>
and someone else will dress you<br>
and lead you where you do not want to go.""<br>
He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God.<br>
And when he had said this, he said to him, ""Follow me.""

That very day, the first day of the week,<br/>two of Jesus’ disciples were going<br/>to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus,<br/>and they were conversing about all the things that had occurred.<br/>And it happened that while they were conversing and debating,<br/>Jesus himself drew near and walked with them,<br/>but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.<br/>He asked them, <br/>“What are you discussing as you walk along?”<br/>They stopped, looking downcast.<br/>One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in reply,<br/>“Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem<br/>who does not know of the things<br/>that have taken place there in these days?”<br/>And he replied to them, “What sort of things?”<br/>They said to him, <br/>“The things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene,<br/>who was a prophet mighty in deed and word<br/>before God and all the people,<br/>how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over<br/>to a sentence of death and crucified him.<br/>But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel;<br/>and besides all this,<br/>it is now the third day since this took place.<br/>Some women from our group, however, have astounded us:<br/>they were at the tomb early in the morning <br/>and did not find his Body;<br/>they came back and reported<br/>that they had indeed seen a vision of angels<br/>who announced that he was alive.<br/>Then some of those with us went to the tomb<br/>and found things just as the women had described,<br/>but him they did not see.”<br/>And he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are!<br/>How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!<br/>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things<br/>and enter into his glory?”<br/>Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets,<br/>he interpreted to them what referred to him<br/>in all the Scriptures.<br/>As they approached the village to which they were going,<br/>he gave the impression that he was going on farther.<br/>But they urged him, “Stay with us,<br/>for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.”<br/>So he went in to stay with them.<br/>And it happened that, while he was with them at table,<br/>he took bread, said the blessing,<br/>broke it, and gave it to them.<br/>With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him,<br/>but he vanished from their sight.<br/>Then they said to each other,<br/>“Were not our hearts burning within us<br/>while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?”<br/>So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem<br/>where they found gathered together<br/>the Eleven and those with them who were saying,<br/>“The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!”<br/>Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way<br/>and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.<br/><br/><br/>

2019-04-20,Saturday,"<div class=""poetry"">In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth,<br>
the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss,<br>
while a mighty wind swept over the waters.<br>
<br>
Then God said,<br/>
""Let there be light,"" and there was light.<br/>
God saw how good the light was.<br/>
God then separated the light from the darkness.<br/>
God called the light ""day,"" and the darkness he called ""night.""<br/>
Thus evening came, and morning followed—the first day.<br/>
<br/>
Then God said,<br/>
""Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters,<br/>
to separate one body of water from the other.""<br/>
And so it happened:<br/>
God made the dome,<br/>
and it separated the water above the dome from the water below it.<br/>
God called the dome ""the sky.""<br/>
Evening came, and morning followed—the second day.<br/>

""Let the water under the sky be gathered into a single basin,<br/>
so that the dry land may appear.""<br/>
And so it happened:<br/>
the water under the sky was gathered into its basin,<br/>
and the dry land appeared.<br/>
God called the dry land ""the earth, ""<br/>
and the basin of the water he called ""the sea.""<br/>
God saw how good it was.<br/>
Then God said,<br/>
""Let the earth bring forth vegetation:<br/>
every kind of plant that bears seed<br/>
and every kind of fruit tree on earth<br/>
that bears fruit with its seed in it.""<br/>

""Let there be lights in the dome of the sky,<br/>
to separate day from night.<br/>
Let them mark the fixed times, the days and the years,<br/>
and serve as luminaries in the dome of the sky,<br/>
to shed light upon the earth.""<br/>

God made the two great lights,<br/>

to shed light upon the earth,<br/>
to govern the day and the night,<br/>
and to separate the light from the darkness.<br/>

Evening came, and morning followed—the fourth day.<br/>

and on the earth let birds fly beneath the dome of the sky.""<br/>

and all kinds of winged birds.<br/>
God saw how good it was, and God blessed them, saying,<br/>
""Be fertile, multiply, and fill the water of the seas;<br/>

cattle, creeping things, and wild animals of all kinds.""<br/>

O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup,<br/>
you it is who hold fast my lot.<br/>

R. <strong>You are my inheritance, O Lord.</strong><br/>

<h4>Reading III <a href=""/bible/readings/bible/Exodus/14:15"">Ex 14:15—15:1</a></h4>
The LORD said to Moses, ""Why are you crying out to me?<br/>
Tell the Israelites to go forward.<br/>
And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea,<br/>
split the sea in two,<br/>
that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land.<br/>
But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate<br/>
that they will go in after them.<br/>
Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army,<br/>
his chariots and charioteers.<br/>
The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD,<br/>
when I receive glory through Pharaoh<br/>
and his chariots and charioteers.""<br/>
<br/>
The angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp,<br/>
now moved and went around behind them.<br/>
The column of cloud also, leaving the front,<br/>
took up its place behind them,<br/>
so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians<br/>
and that of Israel.<br/>
But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed<br/>
without the rival camps coming any closer together<br/>
all night long.<br/>
Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,<br/>
and the LORD swept the sea<br/>
with a strong east wind throughout the night<br/>
and so turned it into dry land.<br/>
When the water was thus divided,<br/>
the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land,<br/>
with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptians followed in pursuit;<br/>
all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them<br/>
right into the midst of the sea.<br/>
In the night watch just before dawn<br/>
the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud<br/>
upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic;<br/>
and he so clogged their chariot wheels<br/>
that they could hardly drive.<br/>
With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel,<br/>
because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
Then the LORD told Moses, ""Stretch out your hand over the sea,<br/>
that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians,<br/>
upon their chariots and their charioteers.""<br/>
So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,<br/>
and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth.<br/>
The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea,<br/>
when the LORD hurled them into its midst.<br/>
As the water flowed back,<br/>
it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army<br/>
which had followed the Israelites into the sea.<br/>
Not a single one of them escaped.<br/>
But the Israelites had marched on dry land<br/>
through the midst of the sea,<br/>
with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br/>
Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day<br/>
from the power of the Egyptians.<br/>
When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore<br/>
and beheld the great power that the LORD<br/>
had shown against the Egyptians,<br/>
they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his servant Moses.<br/>
<br/>
Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:<br/>
I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant;<br/>
horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.

<h4>Reading IV <a href=""/bible/readings/bible/Isaiah/54:5"">Is 54:5-14</a></h4>
The One who has become your husband is your Maker;<br/>
his name is the LORD of hosts;<br/>
your redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,<br/>
called God of all the earth.<br/>
The LORD calls you back,<br/>
like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,<br/>
a wife married in youth and then cast off,<br/>
says your God.<br/>
For a brief moment I abandoned you,<br/>
but with great tenderness I will take you back.<br/>
In an outburst of wrath, for a moment<br/>
I hid my face from you;<br/>
but with enduring love I take pity on you,<br/>
says the LORD, your redeemer.<br/>
This is for me like the days of Noah,<br/>
when I swore that the waters of Noah<br/>
should never again deluge the earth;<br/>
so I have sworn not to be angry with you,<br/>
or to rebuke you.<br/>
Though the mountains leave their place<br/>
and the hills be shaken,<br/>
my love shall never leave you<br/>
nor my covenant of peace be shaken,<br/>
says the LORD, who has mercy on you.<br/>
O afflicted one, storm-battered and unconsoled,<br/>
I lay your pavements in carnelians,<br/>
and your foundations in sapphires;<br/>
I will make your battlements of rubies,<br/>
your gates of carbuncles,<br/>
and all your walls of precious stones.<br/>
All your children shall be taught by the LORD,<br/>
and great shall be the peace of your children.<br/>
In justice shall you be established,<br/>
far from the fear of oppression,<br/>
where destruction cannot come near you.

Sing praise to the LORD, you his faithful ones,<br/>

<h4>Reading V<a href=""/bible/readings/bible/Isaiah/55:1""> Is 55:1-11</a></h4>
Thus says the LORD:<br/>
All you who are thirsty,<br/>
come to the water!<br/>
You who have no money,<br/>
come, receive grain and eat;<br/>
come, without paying and without cost,<br/>
drink wine and milk!<br/>
Why spend your money for what is not bread,<br/>
your wages for what fails to satisfy?<br/>
Heed me, and you shall eat well,<br/>
you shall delight in rich fare.<br/>
Come to me heedfully,<br/>
listen, that you may have life.<br/>
I will renew with you the everlasting covenant,<br/>
the benefits assured to David.<br/>
As I made him a witness to the peoples,<br/>
a leader and commander of nations,<br/>
so shall you summon a nation you knew not,<br/>
and nations that knew you not shall run to you,<br/>
because of the LORD, your God,<br/>
the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you.<br/>
<br/>
Seek the LORD while he may be found,<br/>
call him while he is near.<br/>
Let the scoundrel forsake his way,<br/>
and the wicked man his thoughts;<br/>
let him turn to the LORD for mercy;<br/>
to our God, who is generous in forgiving.<br/>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br/>
nor are your ways my ways, says the LORD.<br/>
As high as the heavens are above the earth,<br/>
so high are my ways above your ways<br/>
and my thoughts above your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
For just as from the heavens<br/>
the rain and snow come down<br/>
and do not return there<br/>
till they have watered the earth,<br/>
making it fertile and fruitful,<br/>
giving seed to the one who sows<br/>
and bread to the one who eats,<br/>
so shall my word be<br/>
that goes forth from my mouth;<br/>
my word shall not return to me void,<br/>
but shall do my will,<br/>
achieving the end for which I sent it.

<h4>Reading VI <a href=""/bible/readings/bible/Baruch/3:9"">Bar 3:9-15, 32C4:4</a></h4>
Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life:<br/>
listen, and know prudence!<br/>
How is it, Israel,<br/>
that you are in the land of your foes,<br/>
grown old in a foreign land,<br/>
defiled with the dead,<br/>
accounted with those destined for the netherworld?<br/>
You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom!<br/>
Had you walked in the way of God,<br/>
you would have dwelt in enduring peace.<br/>
Learn where prudence is,<br/>
where strength, where understanding;<br/>
that you may know also<br/>
where are length of days, and life,<br/>
where light of the eyes, and peace.<br/>
Who has found the place of wisdom,<br/>
who has entered into her treasuries?<br/>
<br/>
The One who knows all things knows her;<br/>
he has probed her by his knowledge--<br/>
The One who established the earth for all time,<br/>
and filled it with four-footed beasts;<br/>
he who dismisses the light, and it departs,<br/>
calls it, and it obeys him trembling;<br/>
before whom the stars at their posts<br/>
shine and rejoice;<br/>
when he calls them, they answer, ""Here we are!""<br/>
shining with joy for their Maker.<br/>
Such is our God;<br/>
no other is to be compared to him:<br/>
he has traced out the whole way of understanding,<br/>
and has given her to Jacob, his servant,<br/>
to Israel, his beloved son.<br/>
<br/>
Since then she has appeared on earth,<br/>
and moved among people.<br/>
She is the book of the precepts of God,<br/>
the law that endures forever;<br/>
all who cling to her will live,<br/>
but those will die who forsake her.<br/>
Turn, O Jacob, and receive her:<br/>
walk by her light toward splendor.<br/>
Give not your glory to another,<br/>
your privileges to an alien race.<br/>
Blessed are we, O Israel;<br/>
for what pleases God is known to us!

The word of the LORD came to me, saying:<br/>
Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their land,<br/>
they defiled it by their conduct and deeds.<br/>
Therefore I poured out my fury upon them<br/>
because of the blood that they poured out on the ground,<br/>
and because they defiled it with idols.<br/>
I scattered them among the nations,<br/>
dispersing them over foreign lands;<br/>
according to their conduct and deeds I judged them.<br/>
But when they came among the nations wherever they came,<br/>
they served to profane my holy name,<br/>
because it was said of them: ""These are the people of the LORD,<br/>
yet they had to leave their land.""<br/>
So I have relented because of my holy name<br/>
which the house of Israel profaned<br/>
among the nations where they came.<br/>
Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord GOD:<br/>
Not for your sakes do I act, house of Israel,<br/>
but for the sake of my holy name,<br/>
which you profaned among the nations to which you came.<br/>
I will prove the holiness of my great name, profaned among the nations,<br/>
in whose midst you have profaned it.<br/>
Thus the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD,<br/>
when in their sight I prove my holiness through you.<br/>
For I will take you away from among the nations,<br/>
gather you from all the foreign lands,<br/>
and bring you back to your own land.<br/>
I will sprinkle clean water upon you<br/>
to cleanse you from all your impurities,<br/>
and from all your idols I will cleanse you.<br/>
I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you,<br/>
taking from your bodies your stony hearts<br/>
and giving you natural hearts.<br/>
I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes,<br/>
careful to observe my decrees.<br/>

you shall be my people, and I will be your God.</div>","<div class=""poetry"">R. (12a) <strong>Create a clean heart in me, O God.</strong><br/>

Brothers and sisters:<br/>
Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus<br/>
were baptized into his death?<br/>
We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death,<br/>
so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead<br/>
by the glory of the Father,<br/>
we too might live in newness of life.<br/>
<br/>
For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his,<br/>
we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.<br/>
We know that our old self was crucified with him,<br/>
so that our sinful body might be done away with,<br/>
that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.<br/>
For a dead person has been absolved from sin.<br/>
If, then, we have died with Christ,<br/>
we believe that we shall also live with him.<br/>
We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;<br/>
death no longer has power over him.<br/>
As to his death, he died to sin once and for all;<br/>
as to his life, he lives for God.<br/>
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as being dead to sin<br/>

so shall he startle many nations,<br/>

He was spurned and avoided by people,<br/>
a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity,<br/>
one of those from whom people hide their faces,<br/>
spurned, and we held him in no esteem.<br/>

Yet it was our infirmities that he bore,<br/>
our sufferings that he endured,<br/>

Though he was harshly treated, he submitted<br/>
and opened not his mouth;<br/>
like a lamb led to the slaughter<br/>
or a sheep before the shearers,<br/>
he was silent and opened not his mouth.<br/>
Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away,<br/>
and who would have thought any more of his destiny?<br/>
When he was cut off from the land of the living,<br/>
and smitten for the sin of his people,<br/>
a grave was assigned him among the wicked<br/>
and a burial place with evildoers,<br/>
though he had done no wrong<br/>
nor spoken any falsehood.<br/>
But the LORD was pleased<br/>
to crush him in infirmity.<br/>
<br/>
If he gives his life as an offering for sin,<br/>
he shall see his descendants in a long life,<br/>
and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.<br/>
<br/>
Because of his affliction<br/>
he shall see the light in fullness of days;<br/>
through his suffering, my servant shall justify many,<br/>
and their guilt he shall bear.<br/>
Therefore I will give him his portion among the great,<br/>

<br/>but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?""<br/>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.<br/><br/>Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm.<br/>And they said to him,<br/>""You are not one of his disciples, are you?""<br/>He denied it and said,<br/>""I am not.""<br/>One of the slaves of the high priest, <br/>a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, <br/>""Didn't I see you in the garden with him?""<br/>Again Peter denied it.<br/>And immediately the cock crowed.<br/><br/>Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium.<br/>It was morning.<br/>And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, <br/>in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.<br/>So Pilate came out to them and said, <br/>""What charge do you bring against this man?""<br/>They answered and said to him,<br/>""If he were not a criminal, <br/>we would not have handed him over to you.""<br/>At this, Pilate said to them, <br/>""Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.""<br/>The Jews answered him, <br/>""We do not have the right to execute anyone, "" <br/>in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled<br/>that he said indicating the kind of death he would die.<br/>So Pilate went back into the praetorium <br/>and summoned Jesus and said to him, <br/>""Are you the King of the Jews?""<br/>Jesus answered,<br/>""Do you say this on your own <br/>or have others told you about me?""<br/>Pilate answered,<br/>""I am not a Jew, am I?<br/>Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.<br/>What have you done?""<br/>Jesus answered,<br/>""My kingdom does not belong to this world.<br/>If my kingdom did belong to this world, <br/>my attendants would be fighting <br/>to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.<br/>But as it is, my kingdom is not here.""<br/>So Pilate said to him,<br/>""Then you are a king?""<br/>Jesus answered,<br/>""You say I am a king.<br/>For this I was born and for this I came into the world, <br/>to testify to the truth.<br/>Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.""<br/>Pilate said to him, ""What is truth?""<br/><br/>When he had said this,<br/>he again went out to the Jews and said to them,<br/>""I find no guilt in him.<br/>But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover.<br/>Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?""<br/>They cried out again,<br/>""Not this one but Barabbas!""<br/>Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.<br/><br/>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.<br/>And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, <br/>and clothed him in a purple cloak, <br/>and they came to him and said,<br/>""Hail, King of the Jews!""<br/>And they struck him repeatedly.<br/>Once more Pilate went out and said to them, <br/>""Look, I am bringing him out to you, <br/>so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.""<br/>So Jesus came out, <br/>wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.<br/>And he said to them, ""Behold, the man!""<br/>When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, <br/>""Crucify him, crucify him!""<br/>Pilate said to them,<br/>""Take him yourselves and crucify him.<br/>I find no guilt in him.""<br/>The Jews answered, <br/>""We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, <br/>because he made himself the Son of God.""<br/>Now when Pilate heard this statement,<br/>he became even more afraid, <br/>and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, <br/>""Where are you from?""<br/>Jesus did not answer him.<br/>So Pilate said to him,<br/>""Do you not speak to me?<br/>Do you not know that I have power to release you <br/>and I have power to crucify you?""<br/>Jesus answered him,<br/>""You would have no power over me <br/>if it had not been given to you from above.<br/>For this reason the one who handed me over to you<br/>has the greater sin.""<br/>Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, <br/>""If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar.<br/>Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.""<br/><br/>When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out <br/>and seated him on the judge's bench <br/>in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.<br/>It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon.<br/>And he said to the Jews,<br/>""Behold, your king!""<br/>They cried out,<br/>""Take him away, take him away!  Crucify him!""<br/>Pilate said to them,<br/>""Shall I crucify your king?""<br/>The chief priests answered,<br/>""We have no king but Caesar.""<br/>Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.<br/><br/>So they took Jesus, and, carrying the cross himself, <br/>he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, <br/>in Hebrew, Golgotha.<br/>There they crucified him, and with him two others, <br/>one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.<br/>Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross.<br/>It read,<br/>""Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.""<br/>Now many of the Jews read this inscription, <br/>because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; <br/>and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.<br/>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, <br/>""Do not write 'The King of the Jews,'<br/>but that he said, 'I am the King of the Jews'.""<br/>Pilate answered,<br/>""What I have written, I have written.""<br/><br/>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, <br/>they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, <br/>a share for each soldier.<br/>They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, <br/>woven in one piece from the top down.<br/>So they said to one another, <br/>""Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be, "" <br/>in order that the passage of Scripture might be fulfilled that says:<br/><em>They divided my garments among them,<br/>and for my vesture they cast lots.</em><br/>This is what the soldiers did.<br/>Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother<br/>and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,<br/>and Mary of Magdala.<br/>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved<br/>he said to his mother, ""Woman, behold, your son.""<br/>Then he said to the disciple,<br/>""Behold, your mother.""<br/>And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br/><br/>After this, aware that everything was now finished, <br/>in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <br/>Jesus said, ""I thirst.""<br/>There was a vessel filled with common wine.<br/>So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop <br/>and put it up to his mouth.<br/>When Jesus had taken the wine, he said,<br/>""It is finished.""<br/>And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.<br/><em><br/>Here all kneel and pause for a short time.</em><br/><br/>Now since it was preparation day,<br/>in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,<br/>for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, <br/>the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken <br/>and that they be taken down.<br/>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first <br/>and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.<br/>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, <br/>they did not break his legs, <br/>but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, <br/>and immediately blood and water flowed out.<br/>An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; <br/>he knows that he is speaking the truth, <br/>so that you also may come to believe.<br/>For this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:<br/><em>Not a bone of it will be broken.</em><br/>And again another passage says:<br/><em>They will look upon him whom they have pierced.</em><br/><br/>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, <br/>secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, <br/>asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus.<br/>And Pilate permitted it.<br/>So he came and took his body.<br/>Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, <br/>also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes <br/>weighing about one hundred pounds.<br/>They took the body of Jesus <br/>and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, <br/>according to the Jewish burial custom.<br/>Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, <br/>and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.<br/>So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; <br/>for the tomb was close by.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h4>Gospel <a href=""/bible/readings/bible/matthew/26:14"">Mt 26:14-25</a></h4>
<div class=""poetry"">One of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,<br>
went to the chief priests and said,<br>
""What are you willing to give me<br>
if I hand him over to you?""<br>
They paid him thirty pieces of silver,<br>
and from that time on he looked for an opportunity to hand him over.<br>
<br>
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<br>
the disciples approached Jesus and said,<br>
""Where do you want us to prepare<br>
for you to eat the Passover?""<br>
He said,<br>
""Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,<br>
'The teacher says, ""My appointed time draws near;<br>
in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples.""'""<br>
The disciples then did as Jesus had ordered,<br>
and prepared the Passover.<br>
<br>
When it was evening,<br>
he reclined at table with the Twelve.<br>
And while they were eating, he said,<br>
""Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.""<br>
Deeply distressed at this,<br>
they began to say to him one after another,<br>
""Surely it is not I, Lord?""<br>
He said in reply,<br>
""He who has dipped his hand into the dish with me<br>
is the one who will betray me.<br>
The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,<br>
but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.<br>
It would be better for that man if he had never been born.""<br>
Then Judas, his betrayer, said in reply,<br>
""Surely it is not I, Rabbi?""<br>
He answered, ""You have said so.""<br>

Reclining at table with his disciples, Jesus was deeply troubled and testified,<br/>""Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.""<br/>The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he meant.<br/>One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved,<br/>was reclining at Jesus' side.<br/>So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom he meant.<br/>He leaned back against Jesus' chest and said to him,<br/>""Master, who is it?""<br/>Jesus answered,<br/>""It is the one to whom I hand the morsel after I have dipped it.""<br/>So he dipped the morsel and took it and handed it to Judas,<br/>son of Simon the Iscariot.<br/>After Judas took the morsel, Satan entered him.<br/>So Jesus said to him, ""What you are going to do, do quickly.""<br/>Now none of those reclining at table realized why he said this to him.<br/>Some thought that since Judas kept the money bag, Jesus had told him,<br/>""Buy what we need for the feast,""<br/>or to give something to the poor.<br/>So Judas took the morsel and left at once. And it was night.<br/><br/>When he had left, Jesus said,<br/>""Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<br/>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself,<br/>and he will glorify him at once.<br/>My children, I will be with you only a little while longer.<br/>You will look for me, and as I told the Jews,<br/>'Where I go you cannot come,' so now I say it to you.""<br/><br/>Simon Peter said to him, ""Master, where are you going?""<br/>Jesus answered him,<br/>""Where I am going, you cannot follow me now,<br/>though you will follow later.""<br/>Peter said to him,<br/>""Master, why can I not follow you now? <br/>I will lay down my life for you.""<br/>Jesus answered, ""Will you lay down your life for me?<br/>Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow<br/>before you deny me three times.""<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God,<br/>did not regard equality with God<br/>something to be grasped.<br/>Rather, he emptied himself,<br/>taking the form of a slave,<br/>coming in human likeness;<br/>and found human in appearance,<br/>he humbled himself,<br/>becoming obedient to the point of death,<br/>even death on a cross.<br/>Because of this, God greatly exalted him<br/>and bestowed on him the name<br/>which is above every name,<br/>that at the name of Jesus<br/>every knee should bend,<br/>of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br/>and every tongue confess that<br/>Jesus Christ is Lord,<br/>to the glory of God the Father.<br/><h4>Verse Before the Gospel <a href=""/bible/readings/bible/Philippians/2:8"">Phil 2:8-9</a></h4>Christ became obedient to the point of death,<br/>even death on a cross.<br/>because of this, God greatly exalted him<br/>and bestowed on him the name which is above every name.<br/>

When the hour came,<br/>Jesus took his place at table with the apostles.<br/>He said to them, <br/>""I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,<br/>for, I tell you, I shall not eat it again <br/>until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.""<br/>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, <br/>""Take this and share it among yourselves; <br/>for I tell you that from this time on <br/>I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine <br/>until the kingdom of God comes.""<br/>Then he took the bread, said the blessing,<br/>broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <br/>""This is my body, which will be given for you; <br/>do this in memory of me.""<br/>And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, <br/>""This cup is the new covenant in my blood,<br/>which will be shed for you.<br/><br/>""And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray me<br/>is with me on the table; <br/>for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined;<br/>but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.""<br/>And they began to debate among themselves <br/>who among them would do such a deed.<br/><br/>Then an argument broke out among them<br/>about which of them should be regarded as the greatest.<br/>He said to them,<br/>""The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them <br/>and those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors'; <br/>but among you it shall not be so.<br/>Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest, <br/>and the leader as the servant.<br/>For who is greater: <br/>the one seated at table or the one who serves?<br/>Is it not the one seated at table?<br/>I am among you as the one who serves.<br/>It is you who have stood by me in my trials;<br/>and I confer a kingdom on you, <br/>just as my Father has conferred one on me, <br/>that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom;

<br/>and once you have turned back,<br/>you must strengthen your brothers.""<br/>He said to him,<br/>""Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.""<br/>But he replied,<br/>""I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day,<br/>you will deny three times that you know me.""<br/><br/>He said to them,<br/>""When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals,<br/>were you in need of anything?""<br/>""No, nothing, "" they replied.<br/>He said to them,<br/>""But now one who has a money bag should take it,<br/>and likewise a sack, <br/>and one who does not have a sword<br/>should sell his cloak and buy one.<br/>For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me,<br/>namely, <em>He was counted among the wicked;</em><br/>and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.""<br/>Then they said,<br/>""Lord, look, there are two swords here.""<br/>But he replied, ""It is enough!""<br/><br/>Then going out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives,<br/>and the disciples followed him.<br/>When he arrived at the place he said to them, <br/>""Pray that you may not undergo the test.""<br/>After withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling,<br/>he prayed, saying, ""Father, if you are willing, <br/>take this cup away from me;

<br/>Peter was following at a distance.<br/>They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it,<br/>and Peter sat down with them.<br/>When a maid saw him seated in the light, <br/>she looked intently at him and said,<br/>""This man too was with him.""<br/>But he denied it saying,<br/>""Woman, I do not know him.""<br/>A short while later someone else saw him and said, <br/>""You too are one of them"";

2019-04-08,Monday,"<div class=""poetry"">In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,<br/>
who married a very beautiful and God-fearing woman, Susanna,<br/>
the daughter of Hilkiah;<br/>
her pious parents had trained their daughter<br/>
according to the law of Moses.<br/>
Joakim was very rich;<br/>
he had a garden near his house,<br/>
and the Jews had recourse to him often<br/>
because he was the most respected of them all.<br/>
<br/>
That year, two elders of the people were appointed judges,<br/>
of whom the Lord said, ""Wickedness has come out of Babylon:<br/>
from the elders who were to govern the people as judges.""<br/>
These men, to whom all brought their cases,<br/>
frequented the house of Joakim.<br/>
When the people left at noon,<br/>
Susanna used to enter her husband's garden for a walk.<br/>
When the old men saw her enter every day for her walk,<br/>
they began to lust for her.<br/>
They suppressed their consciences;<br/>
they would not allow their eyes to look to heaven,<br/>
and did not keep in mind just judgments.<br/>
<br/>
One day, while they were waiting for the right moment,<br/>
she entered the garden as usual, with two maids only.<br/>
She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.<br/>
Nobody else was there except the two elders,<br/>
who had hidden themselves and were watching her.<br/>
""Bring me oil and soap,"" she said to the maids,<br/>
""and shut the garden doors while I bathe.""<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the maids had left,<br/>
the two old men got up and hurried to her.<br/>
""Look,"" they said, ""the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us;<br/>
give in to our desire, and lie with us.<br/>
If you refuse, we will testify against you<br/>
that you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.""<br/>
<br/>
""I am completely trapped,"" Susanna groaned.<br/>
""If I yield, it will be my death;<br/>
if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.<br/>
Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guilt<br/>
than to sin before the Lord.""<br/>
Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,<br/>
as one of them ran to open the garden doors.<br/>
When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden,<br/>
they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.<br/>
At the accusations by the old men,<br/>
the servants felt very much ashamed,<br/>
for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.<br/>
<br/>
When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day,<br/>
the two wicked elders also came,<br/>
fully determined to put Susanna to death.<br/>
Before all the people they ordered:<br/>
""Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah,<br/>
the wife of Joakim.""<br/>
When she was sent for,<br/>
she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.<br/>
All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of the people the two elders rose up<br/>
and laid their hands on her head.<br/>
Through tears she looked up to heaven,<br/>
for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.<br/>
The elders made this accusation:<br/>
""As we were walking in the garden alone,<br/>
this woman entered with two girls<br/>
and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.<br/>
A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.<br/>
When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime,<br/>
we ran toward them.<br/>
We saw them lying together,<br/>
but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we;<br/>
he opened the doors and ran off.<br/>
Then we seized her and asked who the young man was,<br/>
but she refused to tell us.<br/>
We testify to this.""<br/>
The assembly believed them,<br/>
since they were elders and judges of the people,<br/>
and they condemned her to death.<br/>
<br/>
But Susanna cried aloud:<br/>
""O eternal God, you know what is hidden<br/>
and are aware of all things before they come to be:<br/>
you know that they have testified falsely against me.<br/>
Here I am about to die,<br/>
though I have done none of the things<br/>
with which these wicked men have charged me.""<br/>
<br/>
The Lord heard her prayer.<br/>
As she was being led to execution,<br/>
God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,<br/>
and he cried aloud:<br/>
""I will have no part in the death of this woman.""<br/>
All the people turned and asked him, ""What is this you are saying?""<br/>
He stood in their midst and continued,<br/>
""Are you such fools, O children of Israel!<br/>
To condemn a woman of Israel without examination<br/>
and without clear evidence?<br/>
Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.""<br/>
<br/>
Then all the people returned in haste.<br/>
To Daniel the elders said,<br/>
""Come, sit with us and inform us,<br/>
since God has given you the prestige of old age.""<br/>
But he replied,<br/>
""Separate these two far from each other that I may examine them.""<br/>
<br/>
After they were separated one from the other,<br/>
he called one of them and said:<br/>
""How you have grown evil with age!<br/>
Now have your past sins come to term:<br/>
passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent,<br/>
and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says,<br/>
'The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'<br/>
Now, then, if you were a witness,<br/>
tell me under what tree you saw them together.""<br/>
""Under a mastic tree,"" he answered.<br/>
Daniel replied, ""Your fine lie has cost you your head,<br/>
for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him<br/>
and split you in two.""<br/>
Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought.<br/>
Daniel said to him,<br/>
""Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah, beauty has seduced you,<br/>
lust has subverted your conscience.<br/>
This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel,<br/>
and in their fear they yielded to you;<br/>
but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.<br/>
Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.""<br/>
""Under an oak,"" he said.<br/>
Daniel replied, ""Your fine lie has cost you also your head,<br/>
for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two<br/>
so as to make an end of you both.""<br/>
<br/>
The whole assembly cried aloud,<br/>
blessing God who saves those who hope in him.<br/>
They rose up against the two elders,<br/>
for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury.<br/>
According to the law of Moses,<br/>
they inflicted on them<br/>
the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:<br/>
they put them to death.<br/>
Thus was innocent blood spared that day.

Since he had no way of paying it back,<br>
his master ordered him to be sold,<br>
along with his wife, his children, and all his property,<br>
in payment of the debt.<br>
At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said,<br>
'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'<br>
Moved with compassion the master of that servant<br>
let him go and forgave him the loan.<br>
When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants<br>
who owed him a much smaller amount.<br>
He seized him and started to choke him, demanding,<br/>
'Pay back what you owe.'<br/>
Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,<br/>
'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'<br/>
But he refused.<br/>
Instead, he had him put in prison<br/>
until he paid back the debt.<br/>
Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened,<br/>
they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master<br/>
and reported the whole affair.<br/>
His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant!<br/>
I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.<br/>
Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant,<br/>
as I had pity on you?'<br/>
Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers<br/>

When vintage time drew near,<br>

another they killed, and a third they stoned.<br>

Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.'<br>

""Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?""<br>
Jesus answered him, ""Why do you call me good?<br>
No one is good but God alone.<br>
You know the commandments: <em>You shall not kill;<br>
you shall not commit adultery;<br>
you shall not steal;<br>
you shall not bear false witness;<br>
you shall not defraud;<br>
honor your father and your mother.""</br></br></br></br></br></em><br>
He replied and said to him,<br>
""Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth.""<br>
Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him,<br>
""You are lacking in one thing.<br>
Go, sell what you have, and give to the poor<br>
and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.""<br>
At that statement, his face fell,  <br>
and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.<br>
<br>
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,<br>
""How hard it is for those who have wealth<br>
to enter the Kingdom of God!""<br>
The disciples were amazed at his words.<br>
So Jesus again said to them in reply,<br>
""Children, how hard it is to enter the Kingdom of God!<br>
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.<br>
than for one who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God.”<br>
They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves,<br>
“Then who can be saved?”<br>
Jesus looked at them and said,<br>
“For men it is impossible, but not for God.<br>
All things are possible for God.”<br>

2019-02-16,Saturday,"<div class=""poetry"">The LORD God called to Adam and asked him, “Where are you?”<br>
He answered, “I heard you in the garden;<br/>
but I was afraid, because I was naked,<br/>
so I hid myself.”<br/>
Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked?<br/>
You have eaten, then,<br/>
from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat!”<br/>
The man replied, “The woman whom you put here with me--<br/>
she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it.”<br/>
The LORD God then asked the woman,<br/>
“Why did you do such a thing?”<br/>
The woman answered, “The serpent tricked me into it, so I ate it.”<br/>
<br/>
Then the LORD God said to the serpent:<br/>
<br/>
“Because you have done this, you shall be banned<br/>
from all the animals<br/>
and from all the wild creatures;<br/>
On your belly shall you crawl,<br/>
and dirt shall you eat<br/>
all the days of your life.<br/>
I will put enmity between you and the woman,<br/>
and between your offspring and hers;<br/>
He will strike at your head,<br/>
while you strike at his heel.”<br/>
<br/>
To the woman he said:<br/>
<br/>
“I will intensify the pangs of your childbearing;<br/>
in pain shall you bring forth children.<br/>
Yet your urge shall be for your husband,<br/>
and he shall be your master.”<br/>
<br/>
To the man he said:  “Because you listened to your wife<br/>
and ate from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat,<br/>
<br/>
“Cursed be the ground because of you!<br/>
In toil shall you eat its yield<br/>
all the days of your life.<br/>
Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you,<br/>
as you eat of the plants of the field.<br/>
By the sweat of your face<br/>
shall you get bread to eat,<br/>
Until you return to the ground,<br/>
from which you were taken;<br/>
For you are dirt,<br/>
and to dirt you shall return.”<br/>
 <br/>
The man called his wife Eve,<br/>
because she became the mother of all the living.<br/>
<br/>
For the man and his wife the LORD God made leather garments,<br/>
with which he clothed them.<br/>
Then the LORD God said: “See!  The man has become like one of us,<br/>
knowing what is good and what is evil!<br/>
Therefore, he must not be allowed to put out his hand<br/>
to take fruit from the tree of life also,<br/>
and thus eat of it and live forever.”<br/>
The LORD God therefore banished him from the garden of Eden,<br/>
to till the ground from which he had been taken.<br/>
When he expelled the man,<br/>
he settled him east of the garden of Eden;<br/>
and he stationed the cherubim and the fiery revolving sword,<br/>
to guard the way to the tree of life.</br></div>","<div class=""poetry"">

“Did God really tell you not to eat<br/>

The woman answered the serpent:<br/>
“We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;<br/>
it is only about the fruit of the tree<br/>
in the middle of the garden that God said,<br/>
‘You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.’”<br/>
But the serpent said to the woman:<br/>
“You certainly will not die!<br/>
No, God knows well that the moment you eat of it<br/>
your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods<br/>
who know what is good and what is evil.”<br/>
The woman saw that the tree was good for food,<br/>
pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom.<br/>
So she took some of its fruit and ate it;<br/>
and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her,<br/>
and he ate it.<br/>
Then the eyes of both of them were opened,<br/>
and they realized that they were naked;<br/>
so they sewed fig leaves together<br/>
and made loincloths for themselves.<br/>

When they heard the sound of the LORD God moving about in the garden<br/>
at the breezy time of the day,<br/>
the man and his wife hid themselves from the LORD God<br/>

yet later it brings the peaceful fruit of righteousness<br/>
to those who are trained by it.<br/>

So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees.<br/>
Make straight paths for your feet,<br/>
that what is lame may not be dislocated but healed.<br/>
<br/>
Strive for peace with everyone,<br/>
and for that holiness without which no one will see the Lord.<br/>
See to it that no one be deprived of the grace of God,<br/>
that no bitter root spring up and cause trouble,<br/>
through which many may become defiled.</br></div>","<div class=""poetry"">

<h4>Gospel <a href=""/bible/readings/bible/john/2:1"">Jn 2:1-11</a></h4>
<div class=""poetry"">There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee,<br>
and the mother of Jesus was there.<br>
Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.<br>
When the wine ran short,<br>
the mother of Jesus said to him,<br>
""They have no wine.""<br>
And Jesus said to her,<br>
""Woman, how does your concern affect me?<br>
My hour has not yet come.""<br>
His mother said to the servers,<br>
""Do whatever he tells you.""<br>
Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings,<br>
each holding twenty to thirty gallons.<br>
Jesus told them,<br>
""Fill the jars with water.""<br>
So they filled them to the brim.<br>
Then he told them,<br>
""Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.""<br>
So they took it.<br>
And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine,<br>
without knowing where it came from<br>
— although the servers who had drawn the water knew —,<br>
the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him,<br>
""Everyone serves good wine first,<br>
and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one;<br>
but you have kept the good wine until now.""<br>
Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee<br>
and so revealed his glory,<br>
and his disciples began to believe in him.<br>

Some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection,<br/>came forward and put this question to Jesus, saying,<br/>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us,<br/><em>If someone’s brother dies leaving a wife but no child,<br/>his brother must take the wife<br/>and raise up descendants for his brother</em>.<br/>Now there were seven brothers;<br/>the first married a woman but died childless.<br/>Then the second and the third married her,<br/>and likewise all the seven died childless. <br/>Finally the woman also died. <br/>Now at the resurrection whose wife will that woman be?<br/>For all seven had been married to her.”<br/>Jesus said to them,<br/>“The children of this age marry and remarry;<br/>but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age<br/>and to the resurrection of the dead<br/>neither marry nor are given in marriage.<br/>They can no longer die,<br/>for they are like angels;<br/>and they are the children of God<br/>because they are the ones who will rise. <br/>That the dead will rise<br/>even Moses made known in the passage about the bush,<br/>when he called ‘Lord’<br/>the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;<br/>and he is not God of the dead, but of the living,<br/>for to him all are alive.” <br/>Some of the scribes said in reply,<br/>“Teacher, you have answered well.”<br/>And they no longer dared to ask him anything.<br/>

The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,<br/>but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,<br/>""This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."" <br/>So Jesus addressed this parable to them.<br/>""What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them<br/>would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert<br/>and go after the lost one until he finds it?<br/>And when he does find it,<br/>he sets it on his shoulders with great joy<br/>and, upon his arrival home,<br/>he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them,<br/>'Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.' <br/>I tell you, in just the same way<br/>there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents<br/>than over ninety-nine righteous people<br/>who have no need of repentance.<br/><br/>""Or what woman having ten coins and losing one<br/>would not light a lamp and sweep the house,<br/>searching carefully until she finds it?<br/>And when she does find it,<br/>she calls together her friends and neighbors<br/>and says to them,<br/>'Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.' <br/>In just the same way, I tell you,<br/>there will be rejoicing among the angels of God<br/>over one sinner who repents.""<br/>

Great crowds were traveling with Jesus,<br/>and he turned and addressed them,<br/>""If anyone comes to me without hating his father and mother, <br/>wife and children, brothers and sisters,<br/>and even his own life,<br/>he cannot be my disciple.<br/>Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me<br/>cannot be my disciple.<br/>Which of you wishing to construct a tower<br/>does not first sit down and calculate the cost<br/>to see if there is enough for its completion? <br/>Otherwise, after laying the foundation<br/>and finding himself unable to finish the work<br/>the onlookers should laugh at him and say,<br/>'This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.' <br/>Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down<br/>and decide whether with ten thousand troops<br/>he can successfully oppose another king<br/>advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops? <br/>But if not, while he is still far away,<br/>he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms. <br/>In the same way,<br/>everyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions<br/>cannot be my disciple.""<br/>
