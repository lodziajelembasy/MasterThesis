2019-02-03,"When Jesus came to Nazareth, he spoke to the people in the synagogue: ""Today these words of the Scripture that you have heard have come true."" And they all came to Him and marveled at the graces that were flowing from His mouth. And they said, ""Is this not Joseph's son?"" Then he said to them, ""Surely you will tell me this proverb: Doctor, heal yourself, carry out here, in your homeland, what happened, as we heard, in Capernaum."" And he added: ""Verily, I say unto you, No prophet is welcome in his homeland. Really, I say to you: Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky remained closed for three years and six months, so that great hunger reigned in the whole country, and Elijah was not sent to any of them, only to that widow of Zarephath Sarepta, and many lepers were in Israel as the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, only the Syrian Naaman. "" Everyone in the synagogue became angry with these words. Having taken refuge from places, they threw him out of the city and led him to the cliff on which the city was built to make him fall. However, he passed through them and departed."
2019-02-02,"When the days of the purification of Mary according to the Mosaic Law were passed, the parents brought Jesus to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord. For thus it is written in the law of the Lord: ""Every firstborn male child shall be blessed with the Lord."" They were also to sacrifice a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons, as prescribed by the Law of the Lord. And a man lived in Jerusalem, named Simeon. He was a just and pious man, he waited for Israel's consolation and the Holy Spirit rested on him. To him, the Holy Spirit revealed that he would not see death until he saw the Messiah of the Lord. After the Spirit's inspiration, he came to the temple. And when the Parents brought the Child Jesus to act with Him according to the custom of the Law, he embraced Him, blessed God and said: When the days of the purification of Mary according to the Mosaic Law were passed, the parents brought Jesus to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord. For thus is it written in the law of the Lord, ""Now, Lord, allow your servant to leave in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared for all nations: light for enlightenment of the Gentiles and for the glory of your people, Israel."" And his father and mother marveled at what was said about him. Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: ""This is he who is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel and a sign that they will oppose. And your soul the sword will penetrate, let the thoughts of many hearts come to light."" There was also a prophetess Anna, daughter of Fanuela from the generation of Asher, she came very close in the years. She lived with her husband for seven years and remained a widow. It was already eighty-four years old. She did not part with the temple, serving God in fasts and prayers day and night. When she arrived at that moment, she praised God and spoke to him about all who were waiting for the liberation of Jerusalem. And when they had fulfilled everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their city, Nazareth. And the child grew and grew strong, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God rested upon him."
2019-02-01,"Jesus said to the multitudes: ""The kingdom of God is as if someone puts the seed into the earth, whether he is awake or awake, day and night, the seed sprouts and grows, he does not know how. The earth itself yields, first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear, and when the crop matures, the sickle begins to grow, for it is time for harvest. "" He said: ""What are we to compare the kingdom of God with or in what parables we present it?"" It is like a mustard seed, it is the smallest of all seeds on the earth when it is sown in the ground, but sown, grows and becomes larger than other vegetables; large branches, so that the birds of the sky will nest in its shadow. "" In many of these parables, he preached to them as far as they could understand. And without a parable he did not speak to them. He explained everything to his students separately."
2019-01-31,"Jesus said to the people, ""Is this why light is brought in to put it under a bushel or under a bed, not in order to place it on a lampstand?"" For there is nothing hidden that would not come to light. listen, let him listen! "" And he said to them, ""See what you are listening to. The same measure that you measure will measure you out and make it to you, because whoever has it will be added, and whoever does not will deprive him of what he has."""
2019-01-30,"Jesus again began to teach at the lake and a very large crowd gathered with Him. That's why he entered the boat and sat in it, on the lake, and the whole crowd stood on the edge of the lake. He taught them many things in parables and told them in their studies: ""Hear, Behold, the sower went out to sow."" And as he sowed, one seed fell on the road, and the birds came and devoured them. And soon it arose, because it was not deep in the soil, but the sun came down and withered because it had no root, another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew and drowned them, so that it did not bear fruit, others finally fell fertile and seemed fertile yield, rising and growing, and yielded a crop of thirty-fold, sixty-fold and a hundredfold. "" And he added: ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"" And when he was alone, those who were with him, along with the twelve, asked him about the parable. He replied to them: ""You are given the mystery of the kingdom of God, for those who are beyond you, everything happens in parables,"" to look carefully, not to see, listen carefully, and do not understand that they do not repent and are not forgiven them wine. ""And he said to them,"" Do not you understand this parable? How then will you understand other parables? The sower sows the word. And behold, there are those who are on the way: with them the word is sown, and if they hear it, Satan comes in and kidnaps the word sown in them. Similarly, the sowing on the rocky ground are those who, when they hear the word, immediately accept it with joy, but they have no root in them and are unstable. Then when there is oppression or persecution because of a word, they break down immediately. There are others who are sown among the thorns: those who listen to the word, but the concerns of this world, the deceitfulness of wealth and other cravings squeeze in and drown out the word, so that it remains fruitless. Finally, the fertile people planted on the earth are those who listen to the word, accept it and produce a fruit: thirtyfold, sixtyfold and one hundredfold. """
2019-01-29,"The Mother of Jesus came and the brothers, standing outside, sent for him to call him. And a crowd of people sat around him, when they said to him, ""Behold, your mother and brothers are looking for you outside."" He answered them, ""Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"" And looking at those sitting around him, he said, ""Behold my mother and my brethren, for whoever does God's will, he is my brother, my sister and my mother."""
2019-01-28,"The scribes who came from Jerusalem spoke of Jesus: ""He has Beelzebub and casts out evil spirits by the power of the ruler of evil spirits."" Then Jesus called them to them and told them in the parables, ""How can Satan cast out Satan?"" If a kingdom is inwardly quarreled, such a kingdom can not stand, and if a house is divided against itself, then such a house will not be able to stand. therefore Satan stood against himself and is divided against himself, he can not stand, but end with him, no one can enter a strong man's house and rob him, if he does not bind him first, and then he will plunder his house. to you: All sins and blasphemies that would be committed by people will be forgiven them, but whoever would blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will never receive remission, but he must be eternal. "" For they said: ""He has an unclean spirit."""
2019-01-27,"Many have already tried to put together a story about the events that happened among us, just as those who were from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. So I decided to investigate everything right from the first moments and describe you one by one, dignified Theophilus, so that you could be convinced of the absolute certainty of the teachings you were given. At that time: Jesus returned with the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and the news of him spread throughout the whole region. He taught in their synagogues, praised by all. He also came to Nazareth, where he grew up. On the Sabbath day, he went to the synagogue with his custom and rose to read. A book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He opened the book and found a place where it was written: ""The Spirit of the Lord rests upon me, because he has anointed me and sent me, that I may bring good news to the poor, and let the prisoners read freedom, and send free people to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."" Wrapping the book, he gave the servant and sat down; and all eyes in the synagogue were fixed on him. So he began to say to them, ""Today these words of the Scripture that you have heard have come true."""
2019-01-26,"Then the Lord appointed another seventy-two, and sent them two by two in front of him to every city and town where he intended to come. He also said to them, ""The harvest is great, but the laborers are few: ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go, I send you like sheep among the wolves, carry no purse or bag, no sandals, no one When you come to what house you enter, first say: Peace to this house If there is a man who is worthy of peace, your peace will rest on him, if not he will return to you, stay in the same house, eating and drinking what they have: because he deserves his payment, do not go home from home, if you enter and accept you, eat what they give you, heal the sick who are there, and tell them: The kingdom of God has come closer to you."
2019-01-25,"After his resurrection, Jesus appeared to the eleven and said to them, ""Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, whoever believes and receives the baptism will be saved, and whoever will not believe will be condemned. And those who believe will follow these signs. : In my name, the evil spirits will throw away, they will speak in new tongues, they will take snakes into their hands, and if they drink anything of a poison, they will not harm them, they will put their hands on the sick, and they will regain their health. """
2019-01-24,"Jesus moved away with his disciples towards the lake. And a great many people came from Galilee with him. Also from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumea, and from Zajordania, and from the vicinity of Tire and Sidon, many great news came to him about how much he acted. So he instructed his disciples that the boat would be ready for him constantly, because of the crowd, that they would not be stressed against him. For many have healed, and as a result all who have had some illnesses, pressed to Him to touch Him. Even the unclean spirits, at His sight, fell before Him and cried, ""You are the Son of God."" But he strictly forbade them not to reveal Him."
2019-01-23,"On the Sabbath day, Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man who had a withered hand. And they watched him whether he would heal him on the Sabbath to accuse Him. He said to a man with a withered hand: ""Get to the middle!"" He said to them, ""What is allowed on the Sabbath: to do something good or something bad? Save life or kill?"" But they were silent. Then, looking at them with anger, grieved over the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man: ""Hold your hand out!"" He stretched out, and his hand became healthy again. And the Pharisees went out, and with the supporters of Herod, they immediately consulted against Him, how to destroy Him."
2019-01-22,"Once, when Jesus passed on the sabbath among the grains, his disciples began to pick up the ears on the way. The Pharisees said to him, ""Look, why do they do what is not allowed on the Sabbath?"" He said to them, ""Have you never read what David did when he found himself in need and felt hunger, he and his companions?"" When he entered the house of God for Abiathar the high priest, he ate bread that only the priests could eat; and he also gave his companions. "" He added: ""This Sabbath was established for man, and not man for the Sabbath, so the Son of Man is also the Lord of the Sabbath."""
2019-01-21,"The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and asked, ""Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, and let your disciples not fast?"" Jesus answered them, ""Can the wedding guests fast if they are married to them?"" They can not fast as long as they have the bridegroom among them, but the time will come when they take their bridegroom, and then, on that day, they will fast. Nobody sews patches from raw cloth into old clothes, otherwise the new patch will take some of the old clothes off and the tear will be worse. Nobody pours new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the wine will rip off the wineskins. Rather, young wine should be poured into new wineskins. """
2019-01-20,"There was a wedding party in Cana Galilee, and the Mother of Jesus was there. The wedding party was also invited to Jesus and His disciples. And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, ""They have no wine."" Jesus said to her, ""Is it my or your cause, woman? Has not my hour yet come?"" Then His Mother said to the servants: ""Do whatever he tells you."" There were six stone waterpots for Jewish purifications, each of which could hold two or three measures. Jesus said to the servants, ""Fill the jars with water."" And they filled them to the brim. Then he said to them, ""Draw now and take it to the wedding gentleman."" So they carried it. When the wedding star tried the water which became the wine - and he did not know where it came from, but the servants who drew water, they knew - called the bridegroom and said to him: ""Every man puts a good wine first and when they drink, then worse, you have kept good wine until now. "" This is the beginning of the signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him."
2019-01-19,"Jesus went to the lake again. All the people came to Him and He taught him. And passing by, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting in the customs chamber, and said to him: ""Follow me!"" He rose and followed Him. When Jesus sat in his house at the table, many tax collectors and sinners sat with Jesus and His disciples. For there were many who followed him. Some scribes from the Pharisees, seeing that he was with sinners and publicans, said to His disciples, ""Why do He eat them and drink with publicans and sinners?"" Jesus, hearing this, said to them, ""They do not need a physician healthy, but those who are ill, I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."""
2019-01-18,"When Jesus returned to Capernaum after some time, it was heard that he was at home. So many people gathered that there was no place even before the door, and He preached to them the teachings. And they came to him with a paralyzed man who carried four. Not being able to bring him to him because of the crowd, they discovered the roof above the place where Jesus was, and through the hole they dropped the stretcher on which the paralyze lay. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, ""Child, your sins are forgiven."" And there sat a few scribes there who thought in their hearts, ""Why is he saying that? He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins except for one God?"" Jesus immediately knew in his spirit that they think so, and said to them, ""Why do these thoughts bother in your hearts?"" It is easier: to tell the paralytic: Your sins are forgiven, or say: Get up, take your litter and come on? so that you may know that the Son of Man has the power of forgiving sins on earth - he said to the paralytic: I tell you: Get up, take your litter and go to your home! "" He got up, took his stretcher right away and went out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and worshiped God saying, ""We have never seen anything like it before."""
2019-01-17,"One day, he came to the leper of Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him: ""If you will, you can cleanse me."" And Jesus, taken down with pity, extended his hand, touched it and said to him, ""I want to be cleansed."" Immediately leprosy left him and he was cleansed. Jesus commanded him severely and immediately dismissed him, saying to him: ""Take heed that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and make for the purification of the sacrifice which Moses made for a testimony for them."" But after he left, he began to talk and spread what had happened, so that Jesus could not openly enter the city, but was in desert places. And people came to him from everywhere."

With the advent of the evening, when the sun set, all sick and possessed people were brought to Him; and the whole city gathered at the door. He healed many people affected by various diseases and threw away many evil spirits, but he did not let evil spirits speak because they knew Him. In the morning, when it was still dark, he got up, went out and went to a desert place, and prayed there. Simon and his companions followed him, and when they found him, they said to him, ""Everyone is looking for you.""

And he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."
2019-01-15,"In Capernaum, Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and preached. They were astonished at his teaching: he taught them as the one who has power, not as the scribes. A man possessed by an unclean spirit was in their synagogue. He began to cry, ""What do you want from us, Jesus Nazarene? You have come to lose us, I know who you are: God's Holy One."" But Jesus commanded him severely: ""Be silent and leave him!"" Then the unclean spirit began to throw it and with a loud cry came out of it.

2018-11-24,"Jesus approached several Sadducees who claim that there is no resurrection and they said to him in this way: ""Teacher, Moses wrote this to us:"" If a brother who had a wife who was childless dies, let his brother take a widow and let him He will raise offspring for his brother. "" Well, there were seven brothers. The first took his wife and died without children. The second and then the third took her, and they all died without leaving the children. In the end, the woman died. So in the resurrection, which one will he be a wife? All seven of them had her as a wife. "" Jesus said to them, ""The children of this world are getting married and getting married. But those who are deemed worthy of participation in the future world and in the resurrection, neither marry nor marry. They can not die because they are equal to angels and are children of God, being participants in the resurrection. And that the dead will be resurrected, Moses also pointed out where the bush is mentioned, when he calls the Lord ""God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob"". God is not the God of the dead but of the living; for everyone lives for him. "" Some of the scribes said, ""Master, you said well,"" because they did not dare to ask him anything."

But his fellow citizens hated him and sent him a message with a statement: ""We do not want him to reign over us."" When he returned after receiving the royal dignity, he ordered to recall those servants to whom he gave money to find out what everyone gained. So he turned first and said, ""Lord, your face has earned ten minutes."" He replied, ""Well, good servant; because you have been faithful in a small way, rule over ten cities.

He wanted to see Jesus who it is, but he could not because of the crowd because he was short. So he ran forward and climbed to the sycamore tree to see Him, because he was going through that way. When Jesus came to this place, he looked up and said to him, ""Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stop at your house."" So he descended in a hurry and welcomed him. And all seeing this, they murmured: ""He went into hospitality to the sinner."" But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, ""Lord, here I give half of my property to the poor, and if I have hurt anyone in whom I turn, I return four times.""

But he cried even louder: ""Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"" Jesus paused and told him to bring him to him. And when he approached, he asked him, ""What do you want me to do to you?"" He said, ""Lord, let me see."" Jesus answered him, ""Look, your faith has healed you."" He immediately saw and followed Him, praising God. The whole people who saw it also gave glory to God."

When its branch takes on juices and leaves, you know that summer is near. So you, when you see that this is happening, know that it is near, in the door. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things are done. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

But then he said to himself: ""Although I am not afraid of God and I do not count with people, it is because this widow troubles me, I will defend her, so that she would not come without end and torment me."" And the Lord added: ""Listen to what this unjust judge says. And will God not defend his elect, who call to him day and night, and whether he will procrastinate in their cause?

Just as it was during Lot's time: they ate and drank, bought and sold, planted and built, but on the day that Lot left Sodom, a rain of fire and sulfur fell from heaven and destroyed everyone; so it will be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed. In that day he who is on the roof, and his things in the apartment, let him not go down to take them away; And who in the field, let him not return to himself. Remind yourself of Lot's wife. Who will try to save his life will lose it; and whoever loses them will keep them. I say to you: That night two will be on one bed: one will be taken and the other will be left. Two will be ground together: one will be taken and the other will be left. "" They asked Him, ""Where, Lord?"" He said to them, ""Where is the carcass, there will be vultures and vultures."""

And when they were walking, they were cleansed. Then one of them, seeing that he was healed, came back praising God with a loud voice, fell on his face to his feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Jesus said, ""Have not ten been cleansed? Where is nine? Nothing was found that would come back and give glory to God, only this foreigner. "" To him, he said, ""Get up, go, your faith has healed you."""

Would not he say to him, ""Prepare a supper for me, gird yourselves and serve me until I eat and drink, and then you will eat and drink""? Do you thank the servant for doing what he was told? So tell us, when you do what you have been told: ""We are useless, we have done what we should do""."
2018-11-12,"Jesus said to his disciples, ""It is impossible that no scandal should come; but woe to him through whom they come. It would be better for him if the millstone were hung around his neck and thrown into the sea, rather than to be the reason for the sin of one of these little ones. Be careful. If your brother is guilty, reproach him; and if he regrets, forgive him. And if he would sin seven times a day against you and ask you seven times, saying, ""I am sorry,"" forgive him.

"" Then he sat down in front of the treasury and watched as the crowd threw some money into the treasury. Many rich people threw a lot. One poor widow also came and threw in two coins, or one penny. Then he called his disciples and said to them, ""Verily I say unto you, This poor widow put in the most of all who put them in the treasury. They were all throwing in what was giving them away; and she, of her want, threw in everything she had, all her maintenance. """

If you have not been faithful in the management of someone else's good, who will give you yours? No servant can serve two masters. For he will hate either one, and love the other; or he will hold with that, and he will scorn. You can not serve God and mammon.

2018-11-09,"The Jewish Passover season was approaching and Jesus went to Jerusalem. In the temple he met those who sold oxen, lambs and pigeons, and bankers sitting behind the tables. Then, drawing up a whip from strings, he rushed out of the temple, including lambs and oxen, scattered the bankers' coins, and stole the tables. To those who sold pigeons, he said: ""Take this from here, and do not make my marketplace out of the house of my father."" His disciples remembered that it was written: ""Zeal for thy house devours me."" In response, the Jews said to him, ""What sign do you show to us if you do such things?"" Jesus gave them the answer: ""Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days."" The Jews said to him, ""Forty-six years, this temple was built, and you will raise it in three days?"" He spoke about the temple of his body. So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken."
2018-11-08,"All tax collectors and sinners approached Jesus to hear him. The Pharisees and scribes cried, ""This man receives sinners and eats with them."" He then told them the following parable: ""Who among you, having a hundred sheep, and losing one of them, leaves ninety-nine in the wilderness, and does not follow the lost, until he finds it? And when he finds her, he takes her arms joyfully and goes back home; he invites friends and neighbors and tells them: ""Rejoice with me, because I found a sheep that died."" They say to you: Likewise in heaven, greater will be the joy of one sinner who converts than of ninety-nine righteous who do not need conversion. Or if a woman with ten drachmas loses one drachma, does he not light, do not sweep the house and look for it carefully until he finds it? And finding her, she appeals to friends and neighbors and says: ""Rejoice with me, because I found a drachma which I lost"". In the same way, I tell you, joy arises in the angels of God from one sinner who converts. """

Whoever does not bear his cross and follow me can not be my disciple. For who among you, wanting to build a tower, will not sit down first, and do not calculate expenses, does he have to finish? Otherwise, if he had laid the foundations and could not finish them off, everyone would look at it and start mocking him: ""This man started to build, and he could not finish off."" Or which king, having set off to battle the second king, will not sit down first and consider whether he can face ten thousand people against him with twenty thousand? If not, he sends a message while he is still far away, and asks for conditions of peace. So no one of you who renounces everything he has can be my disciple. """

There was a good and just man there, named Joseph, a member of the High Council. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. He took it off the cross, wrapped it in the canvas, and laid it in a grave carved into the rock in which no one had been buried yet. On the first day of the week went the dawn to the grave, carrying the prepared fragrances. The stone from the grave was moved away. And since they came in, they did not find the body of Jesus. When, therefore, they were helpless, suddenly two men in shimmering robes stood before them. Frightened, they bowed their faces to the ground, but they said to them, ""Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, he is risen""."
